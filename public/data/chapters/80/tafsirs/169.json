While he was speaking in direct conversation with him, Ibn Umm Maktum came to him, and he was of those who had accepted Islam in its earliest days. He (Ibn Umm Maktum) then began asking the Messenger of Allah about something, urgently beseeching him. The Prophet hoped that the man would be guided, so he asked Ibn Umm Maktum to wait for a moment so he could complete his conversation. He frowned in the face of Ibn Umm Maktum and turned away from him in order to face the other man. Thus, Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى - أَن جَآءَهُ الاٌّعْمَى - وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُ يَزَّكَّى </div><p>(He frowned and turned away. Because there came to him the blind man. And how can you know that he might become pure) meaning, he may attain purification and cleanliness in his soul.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يَذَّكَّرُ فَتَنفَعَهُ الذِّكْرَى </div><p>(Or he might receive admonition, and the admonition might profit him) meaning, he may receive admonition and abstain from the forbidden.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّا مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى - فَأَنتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّى </div><p>(As for him who thinks himself self-sufficient. To him you attend;) meaning, `you face the rich person so that perhaps he may be guided.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا عَلَيْكَ أَلاَّ يَزَّكَّى </div><p>(What does it matter to you if he will not become pure) meaning, `you are not responsible for him if he does not attain purification.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا مَن جَآءَكَ يَسْعَى - وَهُوَ يَخْشَى </div><p>(But as for him who came to you running. And is afraid.) meaning, `he is seeking you and he comes to you so that he may be guided by what you say to him.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّى </div><p>(Of him you are neglectful and divert your attention to another.) meaning, `you are too busy.' Here Allah commands His Messenger to not single anyone out with the warning. Rather, he should equal warn the noble and the weak, the poor and the rich, the master and the slave, the men and the women, the young and the old. Then Allah will guide whomever He chooses to a path that is straight. He has the profound wisdom and the decisive proof. Abu Ya`la and Ibn Jarir both recorded from `A'ishah that she said about,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى </div><p>(He frowned and turned away.) was revealed.\" At-Tirmirdhi recorded this Hadith but he did not mention that it was narrated by `A'ishah. I say it is reported like this in Al-Muwatta' as well.</p><h2>The Characteristics of the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ </div><p>(Nay; indeed it is an admonition.) meaning, this Surah, or this advice in conveying knowledge equally among people, whether they are of noble or low class. Qatadah and As-Suddi both said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ </div><p>(Nay; indeed it is an admonition.) \"This means the Qur'an.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ </div><p>(So, whoever wills, let him pay attention to Him (it).) meaning, so whoever wills, he remembers Allah in all of his affairs. The pronoun could also be understood to be referring to the revelation since the conversation is alluding to it. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ - مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ </div><p>(In Records held in honor, exalted, purified.) meaning, this Surah or this admonition. Both meanings are connected to each other. Actually, all of the Qur'an is in honored pages, meaning respected and revered.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</div><p>(exalted) meaning, elevated in status.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّطَهَّرَةٍ</div><p>(purified) meaning, from impurity, additions and deficiency. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ </div><p>(In the hands of ambassadors (Safarah),) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd, all said, \"These are the angels.\" Al-Bukhari said, \"Safarah (ambassadors) refers to the angels. They travel around rectifying matters between themselves. The angels when they descend with the revelation of Allah, bringing it like the ambassador who rectifies matters between people.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ </div><p>(Honorable and obedient.) meaning, they are noble, handsome, and honorable in their creation. Their character and their deeds are righteous, pure and perfect. Here it should be noted that it is necessary for one who carries the Qur'an (i.e., the angel) to be following righteousness and guidance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الَّذِي يَقْرَأُ الْقُرْآنَ وَهُوَ مَاهِرٌ بِهِ، مَعَ السَّفَرَةِ الْكِرَامِ الْبَرَرَةِ، وَالَّذِي يَقْرَؤُهُ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ شَاقٌّ، لَهُ أَجْرَان»</div><p>(He who recites the Qur'an proficiently, will be with the noble, righteous, ambassador angels, and the one who recites it with difficulty will receive two rewards.)

While he was speaking in direct conversation with him, Ibn Umm Maktum came to him, and he was of those who had accepted Islam in its earliest days. He (Ibn Umm Maktum) then began asking the Messenger of Allah about something, urgently beseeching him. The Prophet hoped that the man would be guided, so he asked Ibn Umm Maktum to wait for a moment so he could complete his conversation. He frowned in the face of Ibn Umm Maktum and turned away from him in order to face the other man. Thus, Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى - أَن جَآءَهُ الاٌّعْمَى - وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُ يَزَّكَّى </div><p>(He frowned and turned away.

And is afraid.) meaning, `he is seeking you and he comes to you so that he may be guided by what you say to him.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّى </div><p>(Of him you are neglectful and divert your attention to another.) meaning, `you are too busy.' Here Allah commands His Messenger to not single anyone out with the warning. Rather, he should equal warn the noble and the weak, the poor and the rich, the master and the slave, the men and the women, the young and the old. Then Allah will guide whomever He chooses to a path that is straight. He has the profound wisdom and the decisive proof. Abu Ya`la and Ibn Jarir both recorded from `A'ishah that she said about,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى </div><p>(He frowned and turned away.) was revealed.\" At-Tirmirdhi recorded this Hadith but he did not mention that it was narrated by `A'ishah.

The pronoun could also be understood to be referring to the revelation since the conversation is alluding to it. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ - مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ </div><p>(In Records held in honor, exalted, purified.) meaning, this Surah or this admonition. Both meanings are connected to each other. Actually, all of the Qur'an is in honored pages, meaning respected and revered.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</div><p>(exalted) meaning, elevated in status.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّطَهَّرَةٍ</div><p>(purified) meaning, from impurity, additions and deficiency.

The angels when they descend with the revelation of Allah, bringing it like the ambassador who rectifies matters between people.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ </div><p>(Honorable and obedient.) meaning, they are noble, handsome, and honorable in their creation.

Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الَّذِي يَقْرَأُ الْقُرْآنَ وَهُوَ مَاهِرٌ بِهِ، مَعَ السَّفَرَةِ الْكِرَامِ الْبَرَرَةِ، وَالَّذِي يَقْرَؤُهُ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِ شَاقٌّ، لَهُ أَجْرَان»</div><p>(He who recites the Qur'an proficiently, will be with the noble, righteous, ambassador angels, and the one who recites it with difficulty will receive two rewards.)

(76:3) meaning, We explained it to him, clarified it, and made it easy for him to act upon.\" Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd both said the same. This is the most correct view and Allah knows best. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَمَاتَهُ فَأَقْبَرَهُ </div><p>(Then He causes him to die and puts him in his grave.) After creating man, Allah causes him to die and makes him the inhabitant of a grave.

Allah is saying that man has not fulfilled for his Lord the obligations that were imposed upon him.\" What seems apparent to me of its actual meaning -- and Allah knows best -- is that the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ إِذَا شَآءَ أَنشَرَهُ </div><p>(Then when it is His will, He will resurrect him.) means, He will resurrect him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ لَمَّا يَقْضِ مَآ أَمَرَهُ </div><p>(Nay!

Its juice is also extracted to make pulpy fruit drinks and vinegar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحَدَآئِقَ غُلْباً </div><p>(And Ghulb Hada'iq,) meaning, gardens. Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said, \"Ghulb are gardens of date palms that are thick and handsome.\" Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid both said, \"It means everything that is gathered and collected.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةً وَأَبّاً </div><p>(And fruits (Fakihah) and herbage (Abb).) Fakihah includes every type of fruit. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Al-Fakihah is everything that is eaten ripe, and Al-Abb is what the earth grows that is eaten by grazing animals and not people.\" In one narration reported from him he said, \"It is the grass for the livestock animals.\" Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Sallam reported from Ibrahim At-Taymi that he said, \"Abu Bakr As-Siddiq was asked about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةً وَأَبّاً </div><p>(And fruits (Fakihah) and herbage (Abb).) and he said, `What sky would shade me and what earth would carry me if I said about the Book of Allah that which I did not have knowledge of.' \" hIn reference to what Ibn Jarir recorded from Anas, that he said, \"Umar bin Al-Khattab recited</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّى </div><p>(He frowned and turned away.) then when he reached this Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةً وَأَبّاً </div><p>(And fruits (Fakihah) and herbage (Abb).) he said, `We already know what Al-Fakihah is, but what is Al-Abb' Then he said, `By your life, O Ibn Al-Khattab, this is something over burdensome (i.e., unnecessary to ask about).\"' This report has an authentic chain of narration. More than one person has narrated it from Anas. The meaning of the narration is that `Umar wanted to know how it looks, its type and its exact description, because he (`Umar) and everyone who reads this Ayah knows that it is one of the plants that grows from the earth. This is clear due to the Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنبَتْنَا فِيهَا حَبّاً - وَعِنَباً وَقَضْباً - وَزَيْتُوناً وَنَخْلاً - وَحَدَآئِقَ غُلْباً - وَفَـكِهَةً وَأَبّاً </div><p>(And We cause therein the Habb to grow. And grapes and Qadb, and olives and date palms. And Ghulb Hada'iq. And fruits (Fakihah) and herbage (Abb).) And then He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ </div><p>(A provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) meaning, a means of livelihood for you all and your cattle in this life until the (coming of) the Day of Judgement.</p>"
