      "text": "They will ask you for your verdict. SAY: \"Allah (God) advises you (all) concerning indirect heirs (people with no parent or child). If some man should pass away and has no son so while he leaves a sister, then she shall have half of anything he may leave while he inherits from her if she has no child. If they are two women [who are sisters], they shall both have two thirds of whatever he may leave. If they are siblings, both men and women. then each brother shall have the same share as two sisters would have. Allah (God) explains things to you lest you go astray. Allah (God) is (all) Aware of everything!"
