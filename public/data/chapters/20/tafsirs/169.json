This like what is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud, who said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ يُرِدِ اللهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّين»</div><p>(Whomever Allah wants good for, then He gives him the understanding of the religion. ) Mujahid commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى </div><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"This is like His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</div><p>(So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you).) 73:20 For, the people used to hang ropes at their chests (to hang on to when tired) in the prayer.\" Qatadah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى </div><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"No, by Allah, He did not make it a thing of distress. Rather, He made it a mercy, a light and a guide to Paradise.\" Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى </div><p>(But only as a Reminder to those who fear (Allah).) Allah revealed His Book and sent His Messenger as a mercy for His servants, so that the person who reflects may be reminded. Thus, a man will benefit from what he hears of the Book of Allah, it is a remembrance in which Allah revealed what He permits and prohibits. His saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنزِيلاً مِّمَّنْ خَلَق الاٌّرْضَ وَالسَّمَـوَتِ الْعُلَى </div><p>(A Revelation from Him (Allah) Who has created the earth and high heavens. ) means, `This Qur'an, which has come to you, O Muhammad, is a revelation from your Lord. He is the Lord of everything and its King. He is Most Able to do whatever He wills. He created the earth with its low depths and dense regions. He created the lofty heavens with their high altitudes and subtleties.' It has been reported in a Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi and others graded as authentic, that the density of each sky of the heavens is the distance of five hundred years travel and the distance between it and the next heaven is also five hundred years. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى </div><p>(The Most Gracious Istawa the Throne.) A discussion concerning this has already preceded in Surat Al-A`raf, so there is no need to repeat it here. The safest path to take in understanding this, is the way of the Salaf (predecessors). Their way was to accept that which has been reported concerning this from the Book and the Sunnah without describing it, reinterpreting it, resembling it to creation, rejecting it, or comparing it to attributes of the creatures. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى </div><p>(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil.) This means all of this is owned by Him and in His grasp. It is all under His control, will, intent and judgement. He created all of this, He owns it and He is the God of all of it. There is no true God other than He and no Lord other than He. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</div><p>(and all that is under the soil.) Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"This means that which is beneath the seventh earth.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى </div><p>(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) This means that He Who revealed this Qur'an, has also created the high heavens and the earth and He knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. As Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً </div><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") 25:6 `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</div><p>(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) \"The secret is what the son of Adam hides within himself, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخْفَى</div><p>(that which is yet more hidden. ) is the deeds of the son of Adam, which are hidden before he does them. Allah knows all of that. His knowledge encompasses that which has passed and that which is in the future and it is one, complete knowledge. In this regard, all of the creatures are as one soul to Him. That is the meaning of His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</div><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) 31:28 Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى </div><p>(Allah! There is no God but Him! To Him belongs the Best Names.) This means, `He Who revealed this Qur'an to you (O Muhammad), He is Allah, there is no God except Him. He is the Owner of the Best Names and the most lofty attributes.' </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The First Revelation to Musa</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا</div><p>(And when he came to it,) This is referring to the fire when he approached it. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُودِىَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(He was called by name: \"O Musa!\") In another Ayah it says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ</div><p>(He was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: \"O Musa! Verily, I am Allah.\")28:30 However, here Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَنَاْ رَبُّكَ</div><p>(Verily, I am your Lord!) meaning, `the One Who is talking to you and addressing you,' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ</div><p>(So take off your shoes;) `Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Dharr, Abu Ayyub and others of the Salaf said, \"They (his sandals) were from the skin of a donkey that was not slaughtered.\" It has also been said that he was only commanded to remove his sandals due to respect for the blessed spot. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">طُوًى</div><p>(Tuwa) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the name of the valley.\" Others have said the same. This is merely mentioned as something to give more explanation to the story. It has also been said that it is a figure of speech, which comes from the command to place his feet down. It has also been said that it means `doubly sacred' and that Tuwa is something that has repetitious blessings. However, the first opinion is most correct. It is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى </div><p>(When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa.) 79:16 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَا اخْتَرْتُكَ</div><p>(And I have chosen you.) is similar to His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْى اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَـلَـتِي وَبِكَلَـمِي</div><p>(I have chosen you above men by My Messages, and by My speaking (to you).) 7:144 This means over all human beings of that time. It has also been said that Allah said, \"O Musa, do you know why I chose to speak to you directly out of all of the people\" Musa said, \"No.\" Allah then said, \"Because I have not made anyone humble himself as much as you have humbled yourself. \" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَى</div><p>(So listen to that which will be revealed.) \"Now listen to what I say to you and what I reveal to you.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّنِى أَنَا اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلا أَنَاْ</div><p>(Verily, I am Allah! There is no God but Me,) This is the first obligation upon all responsible people of age, that they know that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاعْبُدْنِى</div><p>(so worship Me,) This means, \"Single Me out alone for worship, and establish My worship without associating anything with Me.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى</div><p>(and perform Salah for My remembrance.) It has been said that this means, \"Pray in order to remember Me.\" It has also been said that it means, \"And establish the prayer whenever you remember Me.\" There is a supporting evidence for this second statement in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَقَدَ أَحَدُكُمْ عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ أَوْ غَفَلَ عَنْهَا، فَلْيُصَلِّهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، فَإِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى قَالَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى</div><p>(Whenever one of you sleeps past the prayer, or he forgets to pray, then let him pray when he remembers it. For verily, Allah said, (And perform Salah for My remembrance.)) In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ نَامَ عَنْ صَلَاةٍ أَوْ نَسِيَهَا فَكَفَّارَتُهَا أَنْ يُصَلِّيَهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، لَا كَفَّارَةَةَلهَا إِلَّا ذَلِك»</div><p>(Whoever slept past the prayer, or forgot it, then his expiation is that he prays it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it other than that.) Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ</div><p>(Verily, the Hour is coming) This means that it is established and there is no avoiding it. It will be and it is inevitable. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</div><p>(I am almost hiding it) Ad-Dahhak related from Ibn `Abbas that he used to recite it as, \"I almost kept it hidden -- from myself.\" Ibn `Abbas then would say, \"Because nothing is ever hidden from Allah's Self.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</div><p>(I am almost hiding it.) \"This means that no one knows its appointed time except Me (Allah).\" Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً</div><p>(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.) 7:187 This means that its knowledge weighs heavily upon the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا تَسْعَى</div><p>(that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives.) \"I will establish it and it is inevitable. I will certainly reward every person who does something, according to what he did.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ </div><p>(So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.) 99:7-8 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) 52:16 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكَ عَنْهَا مَن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore, let not divert you the one who believes not therein,) The address here is directed towards all individuals who are responsible (and capable of taking heed to this message). This means, \"Do not follow the way of the person who does not believe in the Hour (Day of Judgement) and he only pursues his desires in this worldly life. He disobeys his Lord and only follows his desires. Whoever behaves like these people, then verily he has failed and lost. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَرْدَى</div><p>(lest you perish.) This means that you will be destroyed and ruined. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى </div><p>(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)) 92:11 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى </div>"

That is Allah has commanded him to place his hand into the opening of his garment, as is clearly stated in another Ayah. It mentioned here merely as a passing reference, saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ</div><p>(And press your hand to your side:) Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ</div><p>(And draw your hand close to your side to be free from fear. These are two signs from your Lord to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) 28:32 Mujahid said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ</div><p>(And press your hand to your side:) \"This means put your palm under your upper arm.\" When Musa put his hand into the opening of his garment and brought it out, it came out shining as if it were a half moon. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(it will come forth white, without any disease) This means without any leprosy, ailment, or disfigurement.

From this Musa knew that he had surely met his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.\" This is why Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَكَ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(That We may show you (some) of Our greater signs.) </p><h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,</h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْهَبْ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى </div><p>(Go to Fir`awn! Verily, he has transgressed.) This means, \"Go to Fir`awn, the king of Egypt, whom you left Egypt fleeing from, and invite him to the worship of Allah alone, Who has no partners.

He was sending him to the mightiest king on the face of the earth at that time. He was the most arrogant and severe of all people in his disbelief, and He had the largest army and the most powerful kingdom. He was the most tyrannical and the most obstinate of rulers. His case was such that he claimed not to know Allah at all, and that he knew of no god for his subjects other than himself. Along with this, Musa lived in his home for a period of time as a child. He stayed in Fir`awn's own room and slept on his bed. Then, after this, he killed one of their people and feared that they would retaliate by killing him in return. Thus, he fled from them and remained an outlaw during this entire time. Then, after all of this, His Lord sent him to them as a warner calling them to worship Allah alone, without associating partners with Him. This is why he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى </div><p>(O my Lord! Open for me my chest, and ease my task for me.)

This is referring to the lisp that he had. This lisp was a result of an incident when he was presented a date and a hot coal stone and he placed the coal on his tongue instead of the date. A detailed explanation of this story is forthcoming in the following chapters. However, he did not ask Allah to remove this affliction all together. Rather, he asked for removal of his stammering so the people would understand what he intended in his speech. He was only asking for what was necessary to deliver his message. If he had asked for the removal of his affliction in its entirety, it would have been cured for him. However, the Prophets do not ask for any more than what is required. Therefore, he was left with the remnants of this accident that took place with his tongue. Allah informed of what Fir`awn said concerning him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ </div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable and can scarcely express himself clearly)43:52 This means that he is not eloquent in speech.

This was also a request from Musa concerning something not pertaining to himself. That was his request for the assistance of his brother, Harun. Ath-Thawri reported from Abu Sa`id, from `Ikrimah, who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Harun was made a Prophet at the same moment that Musa was made a Prophet.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A'ishah went out intending to perform `Umrah and stopped to camp among some bedouins. While she was among them she heard a man say, \"Which brother in this life was the most beneficial to his brother\" The people said, \"We do not know.\" The man said, \"By Allah, I know.\" `A'ishah said, \"I said to myself about his swearing, that he should not swear such an oath, singling himself out as knowing what person was of most benefit to his brother.\" The man said, \"It is Musa, when he asked for prophethood to be bestowed upon his brother.\" Then `A'ishah said, \"By Allah, he has spoken truthfully.\" This is why Allah commended Musa by saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً</div><p>(And he was honorable before Allah.)33:69 Concerning Musa's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى </div><p>(Increase my strength with him.)

If he had asked for the removal of his affliction in its entirety, it would have been cured for him. However, the Prophets do not ask for any more than what is required.

Therefore, with Allah having the great authority and the most perfect power, He determined that Musa would not be raised except upon Fir`awn's own bed. He would be sustained by Fir`awn's food and drink, while receiving the love of Fir`awn and his wife. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَأْخُذْهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّى وَعَدُوٌّ لَّهُ وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى</div><p>(and there, an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his shall take him.

When her breast was presented to him, he took it and they (Fir`awn's family) were extremely happy for this. Thus, they hired her to nurse him and she achieved great happiness and comfort because of him, in this life and even more so in the Hereafter.

Therefore, with Allah having the great authority and the most perfect power, He determined that Musa would not be raised except upon Fir`awn's own bed. He would be sustained by Fir`awn's food and drink, while receiving the love of Fir`awn and his wife.

Rather, they both should remember Allah during their meeting with Fir`awn so that the remembrance of Allah can be an aid for them against him. The remembrance of Allah would be their strength and their power that would defeat him. Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْهَبَآ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى </div><p>(Go both of you to Fir`awn, Verily, he has transgressed.) means that he has rebelled and become haughty and insolent against Allah and he has disobeyed Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُولاَ لَهُ قَوْلاً لَّيِّناً لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى </div><p>(And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah).) This Ayah contains a great lesson. Even though Fir`awn was the most insolent and arrogant of people and Musa was the friend of Allah among His creation at that time, Musa was still commanded to speak to Fir`awn with mildness and softness. Therefore, their invitation to him was with gentle, soft and easy speech that is used by one who is a close friend.

Rather, they both should remember Allah during their meeting with Fir`awn so that the remembrance of Allah can be an aid for them against him. The remembrance of Allah would be their strength and their power that would defeat him. Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْهَبَآ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى </div><p>(Go both of you to Fir`awn, Verily, he has transgressed.) means that he has rebelled and become haughty and insolent against Allah and he has disobeyed Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُولاَ لَهُ قَوْلاً لَّيِّناً لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى </div><p>(And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah).) This Ayah contains a great lesson. Even though Fir`awn was the most insolent and arrogant of people and Musa was the friend of Allah among His creation at that time, Musa was still commanded to speak to Fir`awn with mildness and softness. Therefore, their invitation to him was with gentle, soft and easy speech that is used by one who is a close friend.

This Book is called Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet) and it is the Book of Deeds. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَضِلُّ رَبِّى وَلاَ يَنسَى</div><p>(My Lord neither errs nor forgets.) This means that nothing eludes Him and He does not miss anything, whether it is small or great. He does not forget anything and His Most Exalted knowledge is described as encompassing everything. Blessed be He, the Exalted, the Most Holy and free of any imperfections. The knowledge that creatures have has two deficiencies. The first is that it does not completely encompass anything, and the second is that the creature is prone to forget after knowing. Therefore, Allah has declared Himself above such deficiencies. </p>"

Ibn `Abbas said, \"The day of their festivity was the day of `Ashura'.\" As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, \"It was the day of their great celebration.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"It was the day of their great bazzar.\" These statements are not contradictory. I say that Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his armies on a day similar to this, just as is confirmed in the Sahih. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"It was a flat place where all of the people were on the same level, having an equal view of the event. There was nothing there that would obstruct the view so that some people could see what others did not.\" </p>"

There are also others who recite it as, (إِنَّ هَذَيْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ) Which carries the same meaning, \"Verily, these are two Hadhayn magicians.\" This is the popular style of language in Arabic grammar. The grammarians have extensive discussions in reply to the first recitation and its grammatical explanation, but this is not the place for such a discussion. The main point is that the magicians said among themselves, \"You all know that this man and his brother (Musa and Harun) are two knowledgeable magicians who are quite aware of the skill of magic. They want to defeat you and your people today and conquer the people, causing the masses to follow them. They want to fight against Fir`awn and his armies, and they are seeking victory over him. And their ultimate goal is to expel you from your land.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى</div><p>(and to take you away from your exemplary way.) This means, `they want to expose this way (of yours) openly, which is magic.' For verily, they were considered great because of their magic. They had wealth and sustenance because of this magic. They were actually saying, \"If these two (Musa and Harun) are victorious, they will destroy you and expel you from your land. In doing so, they will be the first individuals to do so, and they will be given great power of leadership without you.\" Ibn `Abbas mentioned concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى</div><p>(and to take you away from your exemplary way. ) \"This means their kingdom, which they were in, and their livelihood.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"This superior way means that which they were upon.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَجْمِعُواْ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ائْتُواْ صَفّاً</div><p>(So devise your plot, and assemble in line.) This means, \"All of you come together in one row, and throw that which is in your hands at one time in order to dazzle the eyes (of the people) and defeat this man and his brother.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْيَوْمَ مَنِ اسْتَعْلَى</div><p>(And whoever overcomes this day will be indeed successful.) meaning \"Between you and us. As for us (the magicians), we have been promised to be given an abundance of power and sovereignty. And in reference to him (Musa), He will gain great leadership.\" </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Competition, Musa's Victory, and the Magician's Faith</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the magicians when they met Musa, that they said to Musa, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ</div><p>(\"Either you throw first...\") meaning, \"you go first.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىقَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ</div><p>(\"...or we be the first to throw\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\") This means, `you magicians should go first so that we can see what magic you are going to perform and so that the true state of their affair will become obvious to the people.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى</div><p>(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) In another Ayah it says that when they threw, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَـلِبُونَ</div><p>(Then said: \"By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!\") 26:44 And Allah, the Exalted, says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic.) 7:116 Here, He says in this Surah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَى</div><p>(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) They were a large numbered group and each one of them threw a stick and a rope until the valley became full of snakes piled on top of each other. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْجَسَ فِى نَفْسِهِ خِيفَةً مُّوسَى </div><p>(So Musa conceived fear in himself.) This means that he feared for the people that they would be tested and deceived by their magic before he could even have a chance to throw what was in his right hand. Thus, Allah revealed to him at the right moment, to throw what was in his right hand, which was the stick. When he did so, it swallowed what they had made. It became a huge, monstrous creature with legs, a neck, a head and fangs. It went after these ropes and sticks until none of them remained, except that it was devoured and swallowed by this beast. At the same time, the magicians and all of the people were watching with their own eyes, seeing this amazing event in broad daylight. Thus, the miracle was performed and the evidence was clear. The truth prevailed and the magic was proven to be falsehood. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا صَنَعُواْ كَيْدُ سَاحِرٍ وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى</div><p>(That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.) So when the magicians saw the event and witnessed it with their own eyes, while they were knowledgeable of the various tricks and methods in the sciences of magic, they knew with conviction that what Musa had done was not magic or illusionary tricks. They recognized that it was the truth without any doubt. They knew that no one had any power to do this except for One Who says for a thing \"Be,\" and it is. Therefore, when this happened, they fell down into prostration to Allah. They said, \"We believe in the Lord of all that exists, the Lord of Musa and Harun!\" This is why Ibn `Abbas and `Ubayd bin `Umayr both said, \"At the beginning of the day they were magicians and at the end of the day they were outstanding witnesses of faith.\" l </p><h2>The Number of Magicians</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The magicians were seventy men who were magicians in the morning, but witnesses of faith by the time evening came.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Al-Awza'i said, \"When the magicians fell down in prostration, Paradise was raised up before them until they were looking at it.\" It is reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُلْقِىَ السَّحَرَةُ سُجَّداً</div><p>(So the magicians fell down prostrate.) \"They saw their places (in Paradise) made clear before them while they were in their prostration.\" `Ikrimah and Al-Qasim bin Abi Bizzah both said the same. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Children of Israel leave Egypt</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs that He commanded Musa to journey at night with the Children of Israel, when Fir`awn refused to release them and send them with Musa. He was to take them away from Fir`awn's captivity. Allah expounds upon this in Surahs other than this noble Surah. Musa left with the Children of Israel, and when the people of Egypt awoke in the morning they found that not a single one of them remained in Egypt. Fir`awn became extremely furious. He sent callers into all of the cities to gather together his army from all of his lands and provinces. He said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـؤُلاءِ لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ - وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, these indeed are but a small band. And verily, they have done what has enraged us.) 26:54-55 Then when he gathered his army and organized his troops, he set out after them and they followed them at dawn when the sun began to rise. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ</div><p>(And when the two hosts saw each other) 26:61 This means that each person of the two parties was looking at the other party. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَا الْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَـبُ مُوسَى إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ - قَالَ كَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِىَ رَبِّى سَيَهْدِينِ </div><p>(The companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\" (Musa) said: \"Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.\") 26:61-62 Musa stopped with the Children of Israel and the sea was in front of them and Fir`awn was behind them. Then, at that moment, Allah revealed to Musa, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً</div><p>(And strike a dry path for them in the sea.) So Musa struck the sea with his stick and he said, \"Split for me, by the leave of Allah.\" Thus, it split, and each separate part of the water became like a huge mountain. Then, Allah sent a wind to the land of the sea and it burned the soil until it became dry like the ground that is on land. For this reason Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً</div><p>(and strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken...) This means being caught by Fir`awn. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَخْشَى</div><p>(nor being afraid.) meaning, \"Do not be afraid of the sea drowning your people.\" Then, Allah, the Exalted, said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ بِجُنُودِهِ فَغَشِيَهُمْ مِّنَ الْيَمِّ</div><p>(Then Fir`awn pursued them with his hosts, but the sea Al-Yamm completely overwhelmed them) Al-Yamm means the sea. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا غَشِيَهُمْ</div><p>(and covered them up. ) meaning, covered them up with a thing that was well-familiar to them in such a situa- tion, as Allah states; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَى - فَغَشَّـهَا مَا غَشَّى </div><p>(And He destroyed the overthrown cities.

The covenant was that he was to fast these number of days, during both the day and night. Thus, Musa made haste to go to the Mountain and he left his brother, Harun, in charge over the Children of Israel.

During this time period, Allah wrote for Musa the Tablets, which contained the Tawrah. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُوْرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَـسِقِينَ </div><p>(And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation for all things (and said): \"Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein.

This means that after Allah informed him of what they were doing, he became extremely angry and upset with them. He was very worried for them. During this time he received the Tawrah, which contained their Shari`ah (Law), this was a great honor for them. For they were a people who used to worship other than Allah. Every person with sound reason and good sense could see that what they were doing was false and foolish. This is why Allah said that he (Musa) returned to them in a state of anger and sorrow. The word for sorrow used here is Asif, which is used to emphasize to the severity of his anger. Mujahid said, \"In a state of anger and sorrow means worried.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"Asif here means in a state of sadness because of what his people had done after him.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يَقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً</div><p>(He (Musa) said: \"O my people!

It is used here to separate between a previous item and a coming item. It is as if it is saying, \"Nay, but you want to make permissible the anger of your Lord upon you by what you have done. Therefore, you have broken your promise to me.\" The Children of Israel said in reply to Musa's blame and rebuke, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا</div><p>(We broke not our promise to you of our own will,) Meaning by our power and our choice. Then, they began making lame excuses and they told him how they got rid of that which they were carrying of Coptic jewelry that they had borrowed from them (the Egyptian Copts) when they left Egypt. Therefore they cast it, meaning that they threw it away. Thus, it became a calf that made a moaning sound that would gradually rise in pitch. This calf was an ordeal, a hindrance and test. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى السَّامِرِىُّفَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ</div><p>(\"...that was what As-Samiri suggested.\" Then he took out (of the fire) for them (a statue of) a calf which was mooing.)

In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah , Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\" </p>"

In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah , Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\" </p>"

Allah says in refuting them and rebuking them, and also explaining to them their folly and foolishness in that which they had done, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً </div><p>(Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) This is about the calf. `Do they not see that it does not respond to them when they ask it and when they speak to it' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</div><p>(and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) Meaning in their worldly affairs and matters of the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nay, by Allah, the moaning sound of the calf was nothing but wind that would enter into its behind and come out of its mouth, thus causing it to make a sound.\" In a Hadith of Al-Fitun recorded from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, it is mentioned that this calf's name was Bahmut. In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah , Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\" </p>"

It has been related in a Hadith about the Sur, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that it is a huge horn that has a circumference as large as the heavens and the earth. The angel Israfil will blow into it. Another Hadith has been related which states that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»</div><p>(How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn is holding it in his lips and his forehead is leaning forward, waiting to be given permission (to blow it).)

This is because on the Day of Judgement they will sense the shortness of the worldly life within themselves. For the worldly life, with its repetitious time periods and successive nights, days and hours, is as if it is just one day. For this reason, on the Day of Resurrection the disbelievers will think the worldly life was very short.

Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"This means that the creatures will be humbled, submissive and compliant to their Compeller, the Ever Living, Who does not die, the Sustainer of all, Who does not sleep.\" He is the maintainer of everything. He determines the affairs of everything and preserves everything. He is perfect in His Self. He is the One Whom everything is in need of and whom nothing could survive without. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً</div><p>(And he who carried wrongdoing, will be indeed a complete failure.) meaning on the Day of Resurrection. For verily, Allah will give every due right to the one who deserved it. Even the ram who lost its horn will be given revenge against the one who had horns. In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Beware of wrongdoing (or oppression), for verily, wrongdoing will be darknesses on the Day of Resurrection.) And the true failure is for whoever meets Allah while associating partners with Him. Allah the Exalted says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(\"Verily, associating partners with Me is the great wrongdoing.\") Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً </div><p>(And he who works deeds of righteousness, while he is a believer, then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) After Allah mentions the wrongdoers and their threat, He then commends the pious people and mentions the judgement they receive. Their judgement is that they will not be wronged nor oppressed. This means that their evils will not be increased and their good deeds will not be decreased. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Zulm means an increase that comes from the sins of others being placed upon the person, and Hadm means a decrease. </p>"

Then, I will be inspired to make praises (of Allah) that I am not able to recall them now. Allah will leave me in this condition as long as He wishes. Then, He will say, \"O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\" Then, a designated group will be allowed for me (to intercede on their behalf). Allah will then enter them into Paradise and I will return (to repeat the process again). ) The Prophet mentioned doing this four times. May Allah's blessings and peace be upon him and the rest of the Prophets as well. In another Hadith it also mentions that he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ تَعَالَى: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، فَيُخْرِجُونَ خَلْقًا كَثِيرًا، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ نِصْفُ مِثْقَالٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مَا يَزِنُ ذَرَّةً، مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ أَدْنَى أَدْنَى مِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَان»</div><p>(Allah, the Exalted, will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a seed's weight of faith in his heart.\" So a large number of people will be brought out. Then He will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a half of a seed's weight of faith in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of a speck of dust in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of the smallest and tiniest particle of dust of faith in his heart.\") And the Hadith continues. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(He knows what happens to them and what will happen to them,) He encompasses all creation with His knowledge. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً</div><p>(but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.) This is like His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ</div><p>(And they will never encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. ) 2:255 Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ</div><p>(And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"This means that the creatures will be humbled, submissive and compliant to their Compeller, the Ever Living, Who does not die, the Sustainer of all, Who does not sleep.\" He is the maintainer of everything. He determines the affairs of everything and preserves everything. He is perfect in His Self. He is the One Whom everything is in need of and whom nothing could survive without. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً</div><p>(And he who carried wrongdoing, will be indeed a complete failure.) meaning on the Day of Resurrection. For verily, Allah will give every due right to the one who deserved it. Even the ram who lost its horn will be given revenge against the one who had horns. In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Beware of wrongdoing (or oppression), for verily, wrongdoing will be darknesses on the Day of Resurrection.) And the true failure is for whoever meets Allah while associating partners with Him. Allah the Exalted says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(\"Verily, associating partners with Me is the great wrongdoing.\") Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً </div><p>(And he who works deeds of righteousness, while he is a believer, then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) After Allah mentions the wrongdoers and their threat, He then commends the pious people and mentions the judgement they receive. Their judgement is that they will not be wronged nor oppressed. This means that their evils will not be increased and their good deeds will not be decreased. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Zulm means an increase that comes from the sins of others being placed upon the person, and Hadm means a decrease. </p>"

Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</div><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</div><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُلْنَا يـَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ</div><p>(Then We said: \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife...\") here wife refers to Hawwa'. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَى</div><p>(So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed.) meaning, `Do not be hasty in doing something that will get you expelled from Paradise, or else you will be fatigued, discomforted and worried, seeking your sustenance. But here, in Paradise, you live a life of ease with no burdens and no difficulties.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَى </div><p>(Verily, you will never be hungry therein nor naked.) The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَؤُا فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَى </div><p>(And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.) These two characteristics are also opposites. Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَـنُ قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى </div><p>(Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away\") It has already been mentioned that he caused them to fall through deception. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ </div><p>(And he swore by Allah to them both: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\") 7:21 It has already preceded in our discussion that Allah took a promise from Adam and his wife that although they could eat from every fruit, they could not come near a specific tree in Paradise. However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</div><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</div><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</div><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</div><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَى ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَى - ثُمَّ اجْتَبَـهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَى </div><p>(Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</div><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.) This Hadith has various routes of transmission in the Two Sahihs as well as the Musnad collections. </p>"

Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</div><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</div><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُلْنَا يـَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ</div><p>(Then We said: \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife...\") here wife refers to Hawwa'. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَى</div><p>(So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed.) meaning, `Do not be hasty in doing something that will get you expelled from Paradise, or else you will be fatigued, discomforted and worried, seeking your sustenance. But here, in Paradise, you live a life of ease with no burdens and no difficulties.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَى </div><p>(Verily, you will never be hungry therein nor naked.) The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَؤُا فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَى </div><p>(And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.) These two characteristics are also opposites. Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَـنُ قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى </div><p>(Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away\") It has already been mentioned that he caused them to fall through deception. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ </div><p>(And he swore by Allah to them both: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\") 7:21 It has already preceded in our discussion that Allah took a promise from Adam and his wife that although they could eat from every fruit, they could not come near a specific tree in Paradise. However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</div><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</div><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</div><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</div><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same.

Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</div><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.)

Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</div><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</div><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُلْنَا يـَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ</div><p>(Then We said: \"O Adam!

The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَؤُا فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَى </div><p>(And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.)

However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</div><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it.

So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed.

      "text": "<h2>The Story of Adam and Iblis</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, man was named Insan only because he was given a covenant, but he forgot it (Nasiya).\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported the same from Ibn `Abbas. Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</div><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</div><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُلْنَا يـَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ</div><p>(Then We said: \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife...\") here wife refers to Hawwa'. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَى</div><p>(So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed.) meaning, `Do not be hasty in doing something that will get you expelled from Paradise, or else you will be fatigued, discomforted and worried, seeking your sustenance. But here, in Paradise, you live a life of ease with no burdens and no difficulties.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَى </div><p>(Verily, you will never be hungry therein nor naked.) The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَؤُا فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَى </div><p>(And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.) These two characteristics are also opposites. Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَـنُ قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى </div><p>(Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away\") It has already been mentioned that he caused them to fall through deception. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ </div><p>(And he swore by Allah to them both: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\") 7:21 It has already preceded in our discussion that Allah took a promise from Adam and his wife that although they could eat from every fruit, they could not come near a specific tree in Paradise. However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</div><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</div><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</div><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"He will not be misguided in this life and he will not be distressed in the Hereafter.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِى</div><p>(But whosoever turns away from My Reminder,) This means, \"Whoever opposes my command and what I have revealed to My Messenger, then he has turned away from it, neglected it and taken his guidance from other than it.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكاً</div><p>(verily, for him is a life of hardship,) meaning, his life will be hard in this world.

Even if he appears to be in comfort outwardly and he wears whatever he likes, eats whatever he likes and lives wherever he wants, he will not be happy. For verily, his heart will not have pure certainty and guidance. He will be in agitation, bewilderment and doubt. He will always be in confusion and a state of uncertainty. This is from the hardship of life. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ أَعْمَى</div><p>(and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.) Mujahid, Abu Salih and As-Suddi said, \"This means he will have no proof.\" `Ikrimah said, \"He will be made blind to everything except Hell.\" This is as Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ</div><p>(And We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell.) 17:97 This is why Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِى أَعْمَى وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيراً</div><p>(O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, while I had sight (before).) This means in the life of this world. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ كَذَلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَـتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنْسَى </div><p>((Allah) will say: \"Like this Our Ayat came unto you, but you disregarded them, and so this Day, you will be neglected.) Meaning, \"When you turned away from the signs of Allah and dealt with them in the manner of one who does not remember them after they were conveyed to you. You neglected them, turned away from them and were heedless of them. Therefore, today We will treat you in the manner of one who has forgotten you.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ نَنسَـهُمْ كَمَا نَسُواْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَـذَا</div><p>(So this Day We shall forget them as they forgot their meeting of this Day.) 7:51 For verily, the punishment will be a retribution that is based upon the type of deed that was done. However, forgetting the words of the Qur'an, while understanding its meaning and acting upon its legislation, is not included in the meaning of this specific threat. Yet, forgetting the words of the Qur'an has been warned against from a different aspect. It has been reported in the Sunnah that it is absolutely forbidden and there is a serious threat against one who forgets Qur'an (that he previously memorized). </p>"

Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَى</div><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ</div><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah.

Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</div><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord!

When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah said to him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</div><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</div><p>(The blessings of the earth.)

However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well.

When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah said to him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</div><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</div><p>(The blessings of the earth.)

However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</div><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)\" Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</div><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.)

He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him (i.e. made easy) and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway (in spite of his not seeking it).) Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَى</div><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ</div><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah. Allah, the Exalted, said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى الصُّحُفِ الاٍّولَى</div><p>(Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former papers (Scriptures)) This means the Qur'an which Allah revealed to him while he was an unlettered man who could not write well and who did not study with the People of the Book. Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</div><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord!

This is like Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</div><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ </div><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ </div><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</div><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</div><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat.

In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ</div><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah. Allah, the Exalted, said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى الصُّحُفِ الاٍّولَى</div><p>(Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former papers (Scriptures)) This means the Qur'an which Allah revealed to him while he was an unlettered man who could not write well and who did not study with the People of the Book. Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</div><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger...\") This means, \"If We had destroyed these rejecting people before We sent this Noble Messenger to them and revealed the Mighty Book to them, they would have said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</div><p>(Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger,) meaning, `before you destroyed us, so we could have believed in him and followed him.' This is like Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</div><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ </div><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ </div><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</div><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</div><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat. Then, Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) \"Say, O Muhammad, to those who deny you, oppose you and continue in their disbelief and obstinance.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ</div><p>(Each one is waiting,) among you and us; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَرَبَّصُواْ</div><p>(so wait you too;) This is a command to await (anticipate). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَـبُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ</div><p>(and you shall know who are they that are on As-Sirat As-Sawi.) This means the straight road. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنِ اهْتَدَى</div><p>(And who are they that have let themselves be guided. ) meaning guidance to the truth and the path of right guidance. This is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً</div><p>(And they will know, when they see the torment, who it is that is most astray from the path!) 25:42 And Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ </div><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is liar, the insolent one!) 54:26 This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, and all praise and gratitude is due to Allah. The Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya' will follow this, if Allah wills. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"
