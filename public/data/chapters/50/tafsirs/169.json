      "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Beginning of the Mufassal Section of the Qur'an</h2><p>This Surah is the first Surah in the Mufassal section of the Qur'an, according to the correct view. It is said that the Mufassal starts with Surat Al-Hujurat. Some common people say that the Mufassal starts with Surah `Amma An-Naba, (chapter 78), however, this is not true because none of the respected scholars ever supported this opinion. Aws (bin Hudhayfah) said; \"I asked the Companions of Allah's Messenger () how they divided the Qur'an. They said; `Three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, and the Mufassal section as one.' \" This was recorded by Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad. If one counts forty-eight Surahs, the next Surah will be Surah Qaf. The details are as follows: The first three Surahs are Al-Baqarah (chapter 2), Al `Imran (3), then An-Nisa' (4). The five are Al-Ma'idah (5), Al-An`am (6), Al-A`raf (7), Al-Anfal (8) and Bara'ah (or At-Tawbah) (9). The seven next Surahs are Surah Yunus (10), Hud (11), Yusuf (12), Ar-Ra`d (13), Ibrahim (14), Al-Hijr (15) and An-Nahl (16). The nine next Surahs are, Subhan (or Al-Isra' (17), Al-Kahf (18), Maryam (19), Ta Ha (20), Al-Anbiya' (21), Al-Hajj (22), Al-Mu`minun (23), An-Nur (24) and Al-Furqan (25). The next eleven Surahs are Surat Ash-Shu`ara (26), An-Naml (27), Al-Qasas (28), Al-`Ankabut (29), Ar-Rum (30), Luqman (31), Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah (32), Al-Ahzab (33), Saba' (34), Fatir (35) and Ya Sin (36). The next thirteen are Surat As-Saffat (37), Sad (38), Az-Zumar (39), Ghafir (40), Ha Mim As-Sajdah (or Fussilat) (41), Ash-Shura (42), Az-Zukhruf (43), Ad-Dukhan (44), Al-Jathiyah (45), Al-Ahqaf (46), Al-Qital (or Muhammad) (47), Al-Fath (48) and Al-Hujurat (49). After that comes the Mufassal section, according to the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. Therefore, Surah Qaf (chapter 50) is the first of the Mufassal, just as we stated, and all praise is due to Allah and all favors are from Him.</p><h2>The Virtues of Surah Qaf</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Abu Waqid Al-Laythi, \"What did the Prophet recite during the `Id Prayer\" Abu Waqid said, \"Surah Qaf and Surat Iqtarabat i.e. Surat Al-Qamar (54).\" Muslim and the Four Collectors of the Sunan collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Hisham bint Harithah said, \"For around two years, or a year and a part of another year, our oven and the oven of the Prophet was one and the same. I memorized Surah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ق وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْمَجِيدِ </div><p>(Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an.) from the tongue of the Messenger of Allah who used to recite it every Friday while standing on the Minbar delivering the Friday sermon to the people.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Abu Dawud also recorded that the daughter of Al-Harith bin An-Nu`man said, \"I only memorized Surah Qaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah who used to recite it in every Friday Khutbah. Our oven and the oven of the Messenger was one and the same.\" Muslim and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah used to recite this Surah during large gatherings such as the `Ids and during Friday sermons. He did so because this Surah contains news of the beginning of creation, Resurrec- tion, the Return, Standing (before Allah), the Reckoning, Paradise, the Fire, Allah's reward and punishment, lessons of encouragement, and lessons of discouragement. Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ق</div><p>(Qaf.) which is one of the letters of the alphabet that are mentioned in the beginning of some Surahs, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ص</div><p>(Sad.)

      "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Beginning of the Mufassal Section of the Qur'an</h2><p>This Surah is the first Surah in the Mufassal section of the Qur'an, according to the correct view. It is said that the Mufassal starts with Surat Al-Hujurat. Some common people say that the Mufassal starts with Surah `Amma An-Naba, (chapter 78), however, this is not true because none of the respected scholars ever supported this opinion. Aws (bin Hudhayfah) said; \"I asked the Companions of Allah's Messenger () how they divided the Qur'an. They said; `Three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, and the Mufassal section as one.' \" This was recorded by Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad. If one counts forty-eight Surahs, the next Surah will be Surah Qaf. The details are as follows: The first three Surahs are Al-Baqarah (chapter 2), Al `Imran (3), then An-Nisa' (4). The five are Al-Ma'idah (5), Al-An`am (6), Al-A`raf (7), Al-Anfal (8) and Bara'ah (or At-Tawbah) (9). The seven next Surahs are Surah Yunus (10), Hud (11), Yusuf (12), Ar-Ra`d (13), Ibrahim (14), Al-Hijr (15) and An-Nahl (16). The nine next Surahs are, Subhan (or Al-Isra' (17), Al-Kahf (18), Maryam (19), Ta Ha (20), Al-Anbiya' (21), Al-Hajj (22), Al-Mu`minun (23), An-Nur (24) and Al-Furqan (25). The next eleven Surahs are Surat Ash-Shu`ara (26), An-Naml (27), Al-Qasas (28), Al-`Ankabut (29), Ar-Rum (30), Luqman (31), Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah (32), Al-Ahzab (33), Saba' (34), Fatir (35) and Ya Sin (36). The next thirteen are Surat As-Saffat (37), Sad (38), Az-Zumar (39), Ghafir (40), Ha Mim As-Sajdah (or Fussilat) (41), Ash-Shura (42), Az-Zukhruf (43), Ad-Dukhan (44), Al-Jathiyah (45), Al-Ahqaf (46), Al-Qital (or Muhammad) (47), Al-Fath (48) and Al-Hujurat (49). After that comes the Mufassal section, according to the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. Therefore, Surah Qaf (chapter 50) is the first of the Mufassal, just as we stated, and all praise is due to Allah and all favors are from Him.</p><h2>The Virtues of Surah Qaf</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Abu Waqid Al-Laythi, \"What did the Prophet recite during the `Id Prayer\" Abu Waqid said, \"Surah Qaf and Surat Iqtarabat i.e. Surat Al-Qamar (54).\" Muslim and the Four Collectors of the Sunan collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Hisham bint Harithah said, \"For around two years, or a year and a part of another year, our oven and the oven of the Prophet was one and the same. I memorized Surah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ق وَالْقُرْءَانِ الْمَجِيدِ </div><p>(Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an.) from the tongue of the Messenger of Allah who used to recite it every Friday while standing on the Minbar delivering the Friday sermon to the people.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Abu Dawud also recorded that the daughter of Al-Harith bin An-Nu`man said, \"I only memorized Surah Qaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah who used to recite it in every Friday Khutbah. Our oven and the oven of the Messenger was one and the same.\" Muslim and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah used to recite this Surah during large gatherings such as the `Ids and during Friday sermons. He did so because this Surah contains news of the beginning of creation, Resurrec- tion, the Return, Standing (before Allah), the Reckoning, Paradise, the Fire, Allah's reward and punishment, lessons of encouragement, and lessons of discouragement.

Allah says that observing the creation of the heavens and earth and all the great things that He has placed in them provides insight, proof and a lesson for every penitent servant who submits in humbleness and repentance to Allah feeling fear, in awe of Him.

      "text": "<h2>Allah encompasses and watches all of Man's Activity</h2><p>Allah the Exalted affirms His absolute dominance over mankind, being their Creator and the Knower of everything about them. Allah the Exalted has complete knowledge of all thoughts that cross the mind of man, be they good or evil. In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى تَجَاوَزَ لِأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل»</div><p>(Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my Ummah (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it.) The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. ) just as He said in the case of dying persons,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ </div><p>(But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not.) (56:85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it.) (15:9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet , who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ</div><p>((Remember) that the two receivers receive,) in reference to the two angels who receive and record the deeds of mankind.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ</div><p>(one sitting on the right and one on the left.) means ready to note,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا يَلْفِظُ</div><p>(whatever he utters), in reference to the human,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن قَوْلٍ</div><p>(of a word), means any word that he or she speaks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</div><p>(but there is a watcher by him ready.) means, but there is a scribe whose job is to record it, leaving no word or movement unrecorded. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَـفِظِينَ - كِرَاماً كَـتِبِينَ - يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(But verily, over you (are appointed angels) to watch you, Kiraman (honorable) Katibin writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) Therefore, the scribe records every word that is spoken, according to the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. This is also the apparent meaning of this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ رِضْوَانِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ يَكْتُبُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَهُ بِهَا رِضْوَانَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاهُ، وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ سَخَطِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ، يَكْتُبُ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ بِهَا سَخَطَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاه»</div><p>(Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, unaware of how highly it will be regarded, and on its account Allah the Exalted and Most Honored decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. A man might indeed utter a word that angers Allah the Exalted, unaware of how dreadful it will be and on its account Allah the Exalted decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.)\" `Alqamah used to say, \"How many words did I not utter because of the Hadith that Bilal bin Al-Harith narrated.\" At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" There is a Hadith similar to this in the Sahih.</p><h2>Reminding Mankind of the Stupor of Death, the Blast of the Trumpet and the Day of Gathering</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most High said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ </div><p>(And the stupor of death will come in truth: \"This is what you have been avoiding!\") Allah the Exalted and Most Honored says, `O mankind! This is the stupor of death that has come in truth; now, I have brought forth to you the certainty that you were disputing,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!), means, `this is the end that you were trying to escape; it has come to you! Therefore, you will have neither a shelter nor a refuge nor a sanctuary nor an asylum from it.' In the Sahih, the Prophet said, while wiping sweat from his face when the stupor of death overcame him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ إِنَّ لِلْمَوْتِ لَسَكَرَات»</div><p>(Glory be to Allah! Verily, death has its stupor.) The Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!) has two possible meanings. One of them is this: `what you have been trying to avert, escape and flee from has come to you and resided in your home!' The second meaning is, `you had no way of escaping or averting this end. ' At-Tabarani collected a Hadith in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir from Samurah who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَثَلُ الَّذِي يَفِرُّ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ مَثَلُ الثَّعْلَبِ تَطْلُبُهُ الْأَرْضُ بِدَيْن، فَجَاءَ يَسْعَى حَتْى إِذَا أُعْيِيَ وَأُسْهِرَ دَخَلَ جُحْرَهُ وَقَالَتْ لَهُ الْأَرْضُ: يَا ثَعْلَبُ، دَيْنِي. فَخَرَجَ وَلَهُ حُصَاصٌ، فَلَمْ يَزَلْ كَذلِكَ حَتَّى تَقَطَّعَتْ عُنُقُهُ وَمَات»</div><p>(The parable of whoever tries to avoid death is that of a fox that had a debt to pay to the earth. The fox went away and when he became tired and the time to sleep overtook him, he entered his den. The earth said to him, `O fox! Pay my debt!' The fox went out howling and continued until his neck was cutoff, (i.e.,) he died.) This parable indicates that just as the fox had no way of escaping or avoiding the earth, likewise, man has no way of avoiding death. Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمَ الْوَعِيدِ </div><p>(And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.) Earlier we discussed the information about the blowing of the Trumpet, the fear that follows it, the death of everything and then resurrection, all this will occur on the Day of Resurrection. We also mentioned that the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ، وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»</div><p>(How can I feel comfort while the angel responsible for the Trumpet has placed the Trumpet to his mouth and lowered his forehead awaiting when he will be commanded (by Allah to blow in it)) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger, what should we say\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيل»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.)\" The Companions repeated this invocation, saying, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs (for us).\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) meaning, an angel to drive him to the gathering place and an angel to bear witness against him with regards to his deeds. This is the apparent meaning of this honorable Ayah and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. It was narrated from Yahya bin Rafi`, the freed servant of Thaqif, that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a speech in which he recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) and then said, \"A Sa'iq to drive every person to Allah the Exalted, and a Shahid to witness against him what he has done.\" The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this. Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) is directed at humanity. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this.), of this Day,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) `your sight is now clear and strong.' Everyone, including the disbelievers, will have clear sight on the Day of Resurrec- tion. However, having sight will not be helpful to the dis- believers on that Day, for Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</div><p>(How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ </div><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord!

In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى تَجَاوَزَ لِأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل»</div><p>(Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my Ummah (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it.) The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. ) just as He said in the case of dying persons,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ </div><p>(But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not.) (56:85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it.) (15:9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet , who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ</div><p>((Remember) that the two receivers receive,) in reference to the two angels who receive and record the deeds of mankind.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ</div><p>(one sitting on the right and one on the left.) means ready to note,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا يَلْفِظُ</div><p>(whatever he utters), in reference to the human,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن قَوْلٍ</div><p>(of a word), means any word that he or she speaks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</div><p>(but there is a watcher by him ready.) means, but there is a scribe whose job is to record it, leaving no word or movement unrecorded. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَـفِظِينَ - كِرَاماً كَـتِبِينَ - يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(But verily, over you (are appointed angels) to watch you, Kiraman (honorable) Katibin writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) Therefore, the scribe records every word that is spoken, according to the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. This is also the apparent meaning of this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ رِضْوَانِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ يَكْتُبُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَهُ بِهَا رِضْوَانَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاهُ، وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ سَخَطِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ، يَكْتُبُ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ بِهَا سَخَطَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاه»</div><p>(Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, unaware of how highly it will be regarded, and on its account Allah the Exalted and Most Honored decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. A man might indeed utter a word that angers Allah the Exalted, unaware of how dreadful it will be and on its account Allah the Exalted decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.)\" `Alqamah used to say, \"How many words did I not utter because of the Hadith that Bilal bin Al-Harith narrated.\" At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" There is a Hadith similar to this in the Sahih.</p><h2>Reminding Mankind of the Stupor of Death, the Blast of the Trumpet and the Day of Gathering</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most High said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ </div><p>(And the stupor of death will come in truth: \"This is what you have been avoiding!\") Allah the Exalted and Most Honored says, `O mankind! This is the stupor of death that has come in truth; now, I have brought forth to you the certainty that you were disputing,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!), means, `this is the end that you were trying to escape; it has come to you! Therefore, you will have neither a shelter nor a refuge nor a sanctuary nor an asylum from it.' In the Sahih, the Prophet said, while wiping sweat from his face when the stupor of death overcame him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ إِنَّ لِلْمَوْتِ لَسَكَرَات»</div><p>(Glory be to Allah! Verily, death has its stupor.) The Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!) has two possible meanings. One of them is this: `what you have been trying to avert, escape and flee from has come to you and resided in your home!' The second meaning is, `you had no way of escaping or averting this end. ' At-Tabarani collected a Hadith in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir from Samurah who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَثَلُ الَّذِي يَفِرُّ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ مَثَلُ الثَّعْلَبِ تَطْلُبُهُ الْأَرْضُ بِدَيْن، فَجَاءَ يَسْعَى حَتْى إِذَا أُعْيِيَ وَأُسْهِرَ دَخَلَ جُحْرَهُ وَقَالَتْ لَهُ الْأَرْضُ: يَا ثَعْلَبُ، دَيْنِي. فَخَرَجَ وَلَهُ حُصَاصٌ، فَلَمْ يَزَلْ كَذلِكَ حَتَّى تَقَطَّعَتْ عُنُقُهُ وَمَات»</div><p>(The parable of whoever tries to avoid death is that of a fox that had a debt to pay to the earth. The fox went away and when he became tired and the time to sleep overtook him, he entered his den. The earth said to him, `O fox! Pay my debt!' The fox went out howling and continued until his neck was cutoff, (i.e.,) he died.) This parable indicates that just as the fox had no way of escaping or avoiding the earth, likewise, man has no way of avoiding death. Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمَ الْوَعِيدِ </div><p>(And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.) Earlier we discussed the information about the blowing of the Trumpet, the fear that follows it, the death of everything and then resurrection, all this will occur on the Day of Resurrection. We also mentioned that the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ، وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»</div><p>(How can I feel comfort while the angel responsible for the Trumpet has placed the Trumpet to his mouth and lowered his forehead awaiting when he will be commanded (by Allah to blow in it)) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger, what should we say\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيل»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.)\" The Companions repeated this invocation, saying, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs (for us).\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) meaning, an angel to drive him to the gathering place and an angel to bear witness against him with regards to his deeds. This is the apparent meaning of this honorable Ayah and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. It was narrated from Yahya bin Rafi`, the freed servant of Thaqif, that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a speech in which he recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) and then said, \"A Sa'iq to drive every person to Allah the Exalted, and a Shahid to witness against him what he has done.\" The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this. Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) is directed at humanity. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this.), of this Day,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) `your sight is now clear and strong.' Everyone, including the disbelievers, will have clear sight on the Day of Resurrec- tion. However, having sight will not be helpful to the dis- believers on that Day, for Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</div><p>(How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ </div><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord!

In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى تَجَاوَزَ لِأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل»</div><p>(Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my Ummah (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it.) The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. ) just as He said in the case of dying persons,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ </div><p>(But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not.) (56:85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it.) (15:9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet , who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ</div><p>((Remember) that the two receivers receive,) in reference to the two angels who receive and record the deeds of mankind.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ</div><p>(one sitting on the right and one on the left.) means ready to note,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا يَلْفِظُ</div><p>(whatever he utters), in reference to the human,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن قَوْلٍ</div><p>(of a word), means any word that he or she speaks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</div><p>(but there is a watcher by him ready.) means, but there is a scribe whose job is to record it, leaving no word or movement unrecorded. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَـفِظِينَ - كِرَاماً كَـتِبِينَ - يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(But verily, over you (are appointed angels) to watch you, Kiraman (honorable) Katibin writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) Therefore, the scribe records every word that is spoken, according to the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. This is also the apparent meaning of this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ رِضْوَانِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ يَكْتُبُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَهُ بِهَا رِضْوَانَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاهُ، وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ سَخَطِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ، يَكْتُبُ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ بِهَا سَخَطَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاه»</div><p>(Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, unaware of how highly it will be regarded, and on its account Allah the Exalted and Most Honored decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. A man might indeed utter a word that angers Allah the Exalted, unaware of how dreadful it will be and on its account Allah the Exalted decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.)\" `Alqamah used to say, \"How many words did I not utter because of the Hadith that Bilal bin Al-Harith narrated.\" At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" There is a Hadith similar to this in the Sahih.</p><h2>Reminding Mankind of the Stupor of Death, the Blast of the Trumpet and the Day of Gathering</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most High said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ </div><p>(And the stupor of death will come in truth: \"This is what you have been avoiding!\") Allah the Exalted and Most Honored says, `O mankind! This is the stupor of death that has come in truth; now, I have brought forth to you the certainty that you were disputing,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!), means, `this is the end that you were trying to escape; it has come to you! Therefore, you will have neither a shelter nor a refuge nor a sanctuary nor an asylum from it.' In the Sahih, the Prophet said, while wiping sweat from his face when the stupor of death overcame him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ إِنَّ لِلْمَوْتِ لَسَكَرَات»</div><p>(Glory be to Allah! Verily, death has its stupor.) The Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!) has two possible meanings. One of them is this: `what you have been trying to avert, escape and flee from has come to you and resided in your home!' The second meaning is, `you had no way of escaping or averting this end. ' At-Tabarani collected a Hadith in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir from Samurah who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَثَلُ الَّذِي يَفِرُّ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ مَثَلُ الثَّعْلَبِ تَطْلُبُهُ الْأَرْضُ بِدَيْن، فَجَاءَ يَسْعَى حَتْى إِذَا أُعْيِيَ وَأُسْهِرَ دَخَلَ جُحْرَهُ وَقَالَتْ لَهُ الْأَرْضُ: يَا ثَعْلَبُ، دَيْنِي. فَخَرَجَ وَلَهُ حُصَاصٌ، فَلَمْ يَزَلْ كَذلِكَ حَتَّى تَقَطَّعَتْ عُنُقُهُ وَمَات»</div><p>(The parable of whoever tries to avoid death is that of a fox that had a debt to pay to the earth. The fox went away and when he became tired and the time to sleep overtook him, he entered his den. The earth said to him, `O fox! Pay my debt!' The fox went out howling and continued until his neck was cutoff, (i.e.,) he died.) This parable indicates that just as the fox had no way of escaping or avoiding the earth, likewise, man has no way of avoiding death. Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمَ الْوَعِيدِ </div><p>(And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.) Earlier we discussed the information about the blowing of the Trumpet, the fear that follows it, the death of everything and then resurrection, all this will occur on the Day of Resurrection. We also mentioned that the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ، وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»</div><p>(How can I feel comfort while the angel responsible for the Trumpet has placed the Trumpet to his mouth and lowered his forehead awaiting when he will be commanded (by Allah to blow in it)) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger, what should we say\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيل»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.)\" The Companions repeated this invocation, saying, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs (for us).\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) meaning, an angel to drive him to the gathering place and an angel to bear witness against him with regards to his deeds. This is the apparent meaning of this honorable Ayah and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. It was narrated from Yahya bin Rafi`, the freed servant of Thaqif, that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a speech in which he recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) and then said, \"A Sa'iq to drive every person to Allah the Exalted, and a Shahid to witness against him what he has done.\" The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this. Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) is directed at humanity. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this.), of this Day,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) `your sight is now clear and strong.' Everyone, including the disbelievers, will have clear sight on the Day of Resurrec- tion. However, having sight will not be helpful to the dis- believers on that Day, for Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</div><p>(How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ </div><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord!

In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى تَجَاوَزَ لِأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل»</div><p>(Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my Ummah (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it.) The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ</div><p>(And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. ) just as He said in the case of dying persons,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ </div><p>(But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not.) (56:85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it.) (15:9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet , who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ</div><p>((Remember) that the two receivers receive,) in reference to the two angels who receive and record the deeds of mankind.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ</div><p>(one sitting on the right and one on the left.) means ready to note,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا يَلْفِظُ</div><p>(whatever he utters), in reference to the human,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن قَوْلٍ</div><p>(of a word), means any word that he or she speaks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</div><p>(but there is a watcher by him ready.) means, but there is a scribe whose job is to record it, leaving no word or movement unrecorded. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَـفِظِينَ - كِرَاماً كَـتِبِينَ - يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(But verily, over you (are appointed angels) to watch you, Kiraman (honorable) Katibin writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) Therefore, the scribe records every word that is spoken, according to the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. This is also the apparent meaning of this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ رِضْوَانِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ يَكْتُبُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لَهُ بِهَا رِضْوَانَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاهُ، وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مِنْ سَخَطِ اللهِ تَعَالَى مَا يَظُنُّ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ مَا بَلَغَتْ، يَكْتُبُ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ بِهَا سَخَطَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ يَلْقَاه»</div><p>(Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, unaware of how highly it will be regarded, and on its account Allah the Exalted and Most Honored decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. A man might indeed utter a word that angers Allah the Exalted, unaware of how dreadful it will be and on its account Allah the Exalted decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.)\" `Alqamah used to say, \"How many words did I not utter because of the Hadith that Bilal bin Al-Harith narrated.\" At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" There is a Hadith similar to this in the Sahih.</p><h2>Reminding Mankind of the Stupor of Death, the Blast of the Trumpet and the Day of Gathering</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Most High said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ </div><p>(And the stupor of death will come in truth: \"This is what you have been avoiding!\") Allah the Exalted and Most Honored says, `O mankind! This is the stupor of death that has come in truth; now, I have brought forth to you the certainty that you were disputing,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!), means, `this is the end that you were trying to escape; it has come to you! Therefore, you will have neither a shelter nor a refuge nor a sanctuary nor an asylum from it.' In the Sahih, the Prophet said, while wiping sweat from his face when the stupor of death overcame him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ إِنَّ لِلْمَوْتِ لَسَكَرَات»</div><p>(Glory be to Allah! Verily, death has its stupor.) The Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</div><p>(This is what you have been avoiding!) has two possible meanings. One of them is this: `what you have been trying to avert, escape and flee from has come to you and resided in your home!' The second meaning is, `you had no way of escaping or averting this end. ' At-Tabarani collected a Hadith in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir from Samurah who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَثَلُ الَّذِي يَفِرُّ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ مَثَلُ الثَّعْلَبِ تَطْلُبُهُ الْأَرْضُ بِدَيْن، فَجَاءَ يَسْعَى حَتْى إِذَا أُعْيِيَ وَأُسْهِرَ دَخَلَ جُحْرَهُ وَقَالَتْ لَهُ الْأَرْضُ: يَا ثَعْلَبُ، دَيْنِي. فَخَرَجَ وَلَهُ حُصَاصٌ، فَلَمْ يَزَلْ كَذلِكَ حَتَّى تَقَطَّعَتْ عُنُقُهُ وَمَات»</div><p>(The parable of whoever tries to avoid death is that of a fox that had a debt to pay to the earth. The fox went away and when he became tired and the time to sleep overtook him, he entered his den. The earth said to him, `O fox! Pay my debt!' The fox went out howling and continued until his neck was cutoff, (i.e.,) he died.) This parable indicates that just as the fox had no way of escaping or avoiding the earth, likewise, man has no way of avoiding death. Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمَ الْوَعِيدِ </div><p>(And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.) Earlier we discussed the information about the blowing of the Trumpet, the fear that follows it, the death of everything and then resurrection, all this will occur on the Day of Resurrection. We also mentioned that the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ، وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»</div><p>(How can I feel comfort while the angel responsible for the Trumpet has placed the Trumpet to his mouth and lowered his forehead awaiting when he will be commanded (by Allah to blow in it)) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger, what should we say\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيل»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.)\" The Companions repeated this invocation, saying, \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs (for us).\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) meaning, an angel to drive him to the gathering place and an angel to bear witness against him with regards to his deeds. This is the apparent meaning of this honorable Ayah and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. It was narrated from Yahya bin Rafi`, the freed servant of Thaqif, that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a speech in which he recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّعَهَا سَآئِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) and then said, \"A Sa'iq to drive every person to Allah the Exalted, and a Shahid to witness against him what he has done.\" The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this. Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) is directed at humanity. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كُنتَ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</div><p>(Indeed you were heedless of this.), of this Day,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَآءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Now We have removed from you, your covering, and sharp is your sight this Day!) `your sight is now clear and strong.' Everyone, including the disbelievers, will have clear sight on the Day of Resurrec- tion. However, having sight will not be helpful to the dis- believers on that Day, for Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</div><p>(How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَارْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ </div><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back (to the world), that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty.)(32:12)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ قَرِينُهُ هَـذَا مَا لَدَىَّ عَتِيدٌ - أَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ - قَالَ قرِينُهُ رَبَّنَا مَآ أَطْغَيْتُهُ وَلَـكِن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ بَعِيدٍ - قَالَ لاَ تَخْتَصِمُواْ لَدَىَّ وَقَدْ قَدَّمْتُ إِلَيْكُم بِالْوَعِيدِ </div>"

The Fire said, \"I have been favored with the arrogant people and tyrants.\" Paradise said, \"What is wrong with me that only the poor and humble people enter me\" Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said to Paradise, \"You are My mercy, with which I grant mercy to those whom I will among My servants.\" He said to Hell, \"You are My punishment which I inflict upon whom I wish from My servants, and I shall fill both of you.\" As for Hellfire, it will not have its fill until Allah puts His Foot over it and she will say, \"Enough! Enough!\" She will become full and its sides will come close to each other. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored shall not be unjust to any one of His creatures. As for Paradise, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored will create another creation to fill it.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُزْلِفَتِ الْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ </div><p>(And Paradise will be Uzlifat to those who had Taqwa, not far off.) meaning, Paradise will be brought close and near to the pious, according to Qatadah, Abu Malik and As-Suddi,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ</div><p>(not far off), and this will occur on the Day of Resurrection, which is not far off. Surely that Day will come to pass and all that is bound to come, is near,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِكُلِّ أَوَّابٍ</div><p>(This is what you were promised -- (it is) for those returning) who go back to Allah in sincere repentance intending not to repeat sin,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَفِيظٌ</div><p>(Hafiz), who preserve their covenant with Allah and do not break or betray it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَشِىَ الرَّحْمَـنَ بِالْغَيْبِ</div><p>(Who feared Ar-Rahman unseen) who feared Allah in secret when only Allah the Exalted and Most Honored could see him. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَرَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللهَ تَعَالَى خَالِيًا، فَفَاضَتْ عَيْنَاه»</div><p>(And a man who remembered Allah the Exalted while alone, and his eyes became tearful.) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَآءَ بِقَلْبٍ مُّنِيبٍ</div><p>(and brought a heart turned in repentance. ) meaning, he will meet Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, on the Day of Resurrection with a heart turned in repentance to Him and absolutely free (of Shirk) and humbled to Him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْخُلُوهَا</div><p>(Enter you therein), meaning Paradise,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسَلَـمٍ</div><p>(in peace and security), they will earn security from the torment of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, and the angels of Allah will greet them with the Salam, according to the explanation of Qatadah. The statement of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ الُخُلُودِ</div><p>(-- this is a Day of eternal life!), meaning, they will reside in Paradise forever and will never die, neither be transferred from it nor wish to be transferred from it. The statement of Allah the All-Mighty,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ فِيهَا</div><p>(There they will have all that they desire), means, whatever delights they wish and desire, they will find it brought before them. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</div><p>(and We have more.) is similar to His other statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</div><p>(For those who have done good is the best and even more. )(10:26) In the Sahih, Muslim recorded that Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi said that `more' refers to looking at the Most Honorable Face of Allah.</p>"

Later, during the Isra' journey, Allah abrogated all of the previous orders for prayer by ordaining five daily prayers, including the prayers of Fajr before sunrise, and `Asr in the late afternoon.

When the bodies grow to their full strength, Allah the Exalted will command angel Israfil and he will blow in the Trumpet (for a second time). The souls will be enclosed in a hole in the Trumpet. When Israfil blows in the Trumpet, the souls will depart from it and will fly between the heavens and earth. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, will declare, \"By My grace and power, each soul shall return to the body that it used to inhabit,\" and indeed, every soul will return to its body. The soul will enter its body just as poison enters the body, then the earth will be uncovered from above them, and they will all stand and head towards the Reckoning place hastening to obey the command of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ </div><p>(Hastening towards the caller.
