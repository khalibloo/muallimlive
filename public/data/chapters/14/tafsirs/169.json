Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it. Soon after, people began embracing the religion of Allah in large crowds and in a very short time Allah's Word and religion became high over all other religions, from the eastern and western parts of the world.

Some idolators said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(O Allah ! If this (Qur'an) is indeed the truth (revealed) from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.) 8:32 It is possible that both meanings are desired here, for the idolators (of Quraysh) invoked Allah against themselves on the day of Badr, and the Messenger of Allah invoked Him for victory and support. Allah said to the idolators then,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ</div><p>(and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction.) those who were arrogant and rebelled against the truth. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلْقِيَا فِى جَهَنَّمَ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ - مَّنَّـعٍ لِّلْخَيْرِ مُعْتَدٍ مُّرِيبٍ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ فَأَلْقِيَـهُ فِى الْعَذَابِ الشَّدِيدِ </div><p>((Allah will say to the angels): \"Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever - hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, who set up another deity with Allah. Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.\") 50:24-26 The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُ يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَتُنَادِي الْخَلَائِقَ، فَتَقُولُ: إِنِّي وُكِّلْتُ بِكُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيد»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, Jahannam (Hellfire) will be brought and it will call the creatures, saying, \"I was given the responsibility of every rebellious tyrant.\") Therefore, every tyrant has earned utter demise and loss when the Prophets invoked Allah, the Mighty, the Able for victory. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ</div><p>(In front of him is Hell,) Allah says that Jahannam is in front of every obstinate tyrant, awaiting him, and he will reside in it forever on the Day of Return. He will be brought to it in the morning and the afternoon until the Day of the Call,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْقَى مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ</div><p>(and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.) in the Fire, his only drink will be from Hamim and Ghassaq, the former is very hot and the latter is very cold and rotten. Allah said in another instance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ </div><p>(This is so! Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(And be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels. ) 47:15 and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِى الْوجُوهَ</div><p>(And if they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces.) 18:29 Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَتَجَرَّعُهُ</div><p>(He will sip it unwillingly), indicates that he will hate to drink this water, but he will be forced to sip it; he will refuse until the angel strikes him with an iron bar,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ </div><p>(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)22:21 Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ</div><p>(and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat,) meaning, he will hate to swallow it because of its awful taste, color and unbearable heat or coldness,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ</div><p>(and death will come to him from every side,) his organs, limbs and entire body will suffer pain because of this drink. `Amr bin Maymun bin Mahran commented, \"Every bone, nerve and blood vessel.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ</div><p>(and death will come to him from every side,) \"All types of torment that Allah will punish him with on the Day of Resurrection in the fire of Jahannam will come to him carrying death, if he were to die. However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ</div><p>(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ</div><p>(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ </div><p>(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ </div><p>(This is the Hell which the criminals denied. They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!)55:43-44,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ شَجَرَةَ الزَّقُّومِ - طَعَامُ الاٌّثِيمِ - كَالْمُهْلِ يَغْلِى فِى الْبُطُونِ - كَغَلْىِ الْحَمِيمِ - خُذُوهُ فَاعْتِلُوهُ إِلَى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - ثُمَّ صُبُّواْ فَوْقَ رَأْسِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْحَمِيمِ - ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ - إِنَّ هَـذَا مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تَمْتَرُونَ </div><p>(Verily, the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinners. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said) \"Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!\")44:43-50, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الشِّمَالِ - فِى سَمُومٍ وَحَمِيمٍ - وَظِلٍّ مِّن يَحْمُومٍ - لاَّ بَارِدٍ وَلاَ كَرِيمٍ </div><p>(And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand In fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor pleasant.)56:41-44 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّـغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَـَابٍ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ - هَـذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ - وَءَاخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَجٌ </div><p>(This is so!

Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this.

Allah kept granting His Messenger more dominance until He opened for him Makkah, which sought to expel him. Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it.

Allah gave him dominance over it, even when his enemies from Makkah and the rest of the people of the earth disliked it.

Some idolators said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(O Allah !

Allah said to the idolators then,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>((O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now has the judgment come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you.) 8:19 Allah knows best.

Some idolators said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(O Allah !

Then let them taste it - Hamim and Ghassaq. And other (torments) of similar kind all together!)38:57-58 Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that this festering water is made of puss and blood.

However, he will not die because Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it affect them that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them)35:36.\" Therefore, according to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, every type of punishment will come to him (the obstinate, rebellious tyrant) carrying death with it, if he will ever die there. Yet, he will not die, he will instead receive eternal punishment and torment. Hence Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَأْتِيهِ الْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ</div><p>(and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die,) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ</div><p>(and in front of him, will be a great torment.) even in this condition, he will still suffer another severe type of torment, more severe and painful from the one before it, harsher more bitter. Allah described the tree of Zaqqum,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٌ تَخْرُجُ فِى أَصْلِ الْجَحِيمِ - طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُءُوسُ الشَّيَـطِينِ - فَإِنَّهُمْ لاّكِلُونَ مِنْهَا فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا الْبُطُونَ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ لَهُمْ عَلَيْهَا لَشَوْباً مِنْ حَمِيمٍ - ثُمَّ إِنَّ مَرْجِعَهُمْ لإِلَى الْجَحِيمِ </div><p>(Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire, the shoots of its fruits stalks are like the heads of Shayatin; Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.)37:64-68 Allah states that they will either be eating from the Zaqqum, drinking the Hamim, or being tormented in the Fire, again and again; we seek refuge with Allah from all of this. Allah also said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ - يَطُوفُونَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ </div><p>(This is the Hell which the criminals denied.

Then, the angel of death, will come until he sits right next to his head, saying, \"O, good and pure soul! Depart (your body) to Allah's forgiveness and pleasure.\" So the soul flows (out of its body), just as the drop flows out from the tip of the jug, and the angel of death captures it. When he captures the soul, they (the group of angels) will not leave it with him for more than an instance, and they will seize it and wrap it in that shroud, and in that fragrance. A most pleasant musk scent ever found on the earth, will flow out of the soul, and the angels will ascend it (to heaven). They will not pass by, but they will say, \"Whose is this Tayyib (good) soul\" They (the angels who are ascending the soul) will reply, \"Such person, the son of such and such person,\" -- calling him by the best names that he used to be called in the world. They will reach the lower heaven and will ask that its door be opened for him, and it will be opened for them. The best residents of every heaven will then see him to the next heaven, until he is brought to the seventh heaven. Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, will say, \"List my servants record in `Illiyyin and send him back to earth, for I have created them from it, and into it I shall return them, and from it I shall bring them out once again.\" The soul will be joined with its body, and two angels will come to him, sit him up and ask him, \"Who is your Lord\" He will say, \"Allah is my Lord.\" They will ask him, \"What is your religion\" He will say, \"My religion is Islam.\" They will say to him, \"What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad) who was sent to you\" He will say, \"He is the Messenger of Allah.\" They will ask him, \"And what proof do you have about it\" He will say, \"I read the Book of Allah (the Qur'an), and had faith and belief in him.\" Then, a caller (Allah) will herald from heaven, \"My servant has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him from Paradise, and let him wear from (the clothes of) Paradise, and open a door for him to Paradise.\" So he is given from Paradise's tranquillity and good scent, and his grave will be expanded for him as far as his sight can reach.

He ordained the prayer, which affirms the worship of Allah alone, without partners, and to spend from the provisions that He has granted them, by paying the due Zakah, spending on relatives and being kind to all others. Establishing the prayer requires performing it on time, perfectly, preserving its act of bowing having humility during it, and preserving its prostrations. Allah has ordained spending from what He granted, in secret and public, so that the people save themselves,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ</div><p>(before the coming of a Day), the Day of Resurrection,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خِلَـلٌ</div><p>(on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.) on which no ransom will be accepted from anyone, if he seeks to buy himself. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنكُمْ فِدْيَةٌ وَلاَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you, nor of those who disbelieved.) 57:15 Allah said here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ خِلَـلٌ</div><p>(nor befriending.) Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah says that on that Day, there will be no friendship between friends that might save those deserving punishment from it. Rather, on that Day, there will be fairness and justice.\" Qatadah said, \"Allah knows that in this life, there is mutual bargaining and there are friendships which people benefit from. A man chooses his friends and the reasons behind befriending them; if it was for Allah's sake, their friendship should be maintained, but if it was for other than Allah, their friendship is bound to be cutoff.\" I say that the meaning of this, is that Allah the Exalted is declaring that on that Day, no mutual bargaining or ransom will avail anyone, even if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold if he could find that amount! No friendship or intercession shall avail one if he meets Allah while a disbeliever. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا لاَّ تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَـعَةٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ </div><p>(And fear the Day when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped.)2:123 and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَنفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَـكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خُلَّةٌ وَلاَ شَفَـعَةٌ وَالْكَـفِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ </div><p>(O you believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.)2:254</p>"

At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it, and At-Tirmidhi said \"Hasan Sahih\". Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded in his Sahih that Thawban the servant of the Messenger of Allah said, \"I was standing next to the Messenger of Allah when a Jewish rabbi came to him and said, `Peace be to you, O Muhammad.' I pushed him with such a force that almost caused him to fall down and he asked me why I did that. I said, `Why did you not say, `O Messenger of Allah' The Jew said, `We call him by the name which his family gave him.' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اسْمِي مُحَمَّدٌ الَّذِي سَمَّانِي بِهِ أهْلِي»</div><p>(Muhammad is indeed the name which my family gave me.)

The Messenger of Allah poked the ground with a staff he had and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَل»</div><p>(Ask.) The Jew said, `Where will the people be when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will the heavens' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هُمْ فِي الظُّلْمَةِ دُونَ الْجَسْر»</div><p>قال: فمن أول الناس إجازة؟ فقال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فُقَرَاءُ الْمُهَاجِرِين»</div><p>، فقال اليهودي: فما تحفتهم حين يدخلون الجنة؟ قال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«زِيَادَةُ كَبِدِ النُّون»</div><p>قال: فما غذاؤهم في إثرها؟ قال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُنْحَرُ لَهُمْ ثَوْرُ الْجَنَّةِ الَّذِي كَانَ يَأْكُلُ مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا»</div><p>قال: فما شرابهم عليه؟ قال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مِنْ عَيْنٍ فِيهَا تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلًا»</div><p>. قال: صدقت، قال: وجئت أسألك عن شيء لا يعلمه أحد من أهل الأرض إلا نبي أو رجل أو رجلان. قال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَنْفَعُكَ إِنْ حَدَّثْتُكَ؟»</div><p>قال: أسمع بأذني. قال: جئت أسألك عن الولد، قال:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَاءُ الرُّجُلِ أَبْيَضُ، وَمَاءُ الْمَرْأَةِ أَصْفَرُ، فَإِذَا اجْتَمَعَا فَعَلَا مَنِيُّ الرُّجُلِ مَنِيَّ الْمَرْأَةِ، أَذْكَرَا بِإِذْنِ اللهِ تَعَالَى، وَإِذَا عَلَا مَنِيُّ الْمَرْأَةِ مَنِيَّ الرَّجُلِ، أَنَّثَا بِإِذْنِ الله»</div><p>قال اليهودي: لقد صدقت وإنك لنبي ثم انصرف، فقال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَقَدْ سَأَلَنِي هَذَا عَنِ الَّذِي سَأَلَنِي عَنْهُ، وَمَا لِي عِلْمٌ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْهُ حَتَّى أَتَانِي اللهُ بِه»</div><p>(In the darkness before the Bridge (Jasr).) He asked, `Who will be the first to pass it' He said, (The poor emigrants (Muhajirin).) He asked, `What will their (refreshment) be when they enter Paradise' He said, (The caul of fish liver.) He asked, `What will they have after that' He said, (A bull of Paradise which grazed through its pathways will be slaughtered for them.) He asked, `From what will they drink' He said, (From a fountain whose name is Salsabil. ) He said, `You have said the truth. I have come to ask you something about which none of the inhabitants of the earth knows, with the exception of a Prophet or one or two other men.' He said, (Would you benefit by me informing you about it) He replied, `I would listen. I have come to ask you about the child.' He said, (The fluid of the man is white, and the woman's is yellow. When they meet, if the discharge of the man is greater than that of the woman, then it becomes a male, by Allah's permission. When the womans discharge is greater than the man's, it becomes a female by Allah's permission.) The Jew said, `You have told the truth and are indeed a Prophet.' Then he left. So Allah's Messenger said; (He asked me such things that I had no knowledge of it until Allah gave it to me.)
