This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّـشِطَـتِ نَشْطاً </div><p>(By those who free briskly.) This has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِحَـتِ سَبْحاً </div><p>(And by the swimmers, swimming.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"They are the angels.\" Similar statements have been reported from `Ali, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالسَّـبِقَـتِ سَبْقاً </div><p>(And by the racers, racing.) It has been narrated from `Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, \"In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ </div><p>(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ</div><p>(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.) (73:14) The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُمِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَحِدَةً </div><p>(And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.) (69:14)\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ </div><p>(Hearts that Day will tremble.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ </div><p>(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ </div><p>(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah\") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً </div><p>(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ</div><p>(It would in that case be a return with loss.)

The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً </div><p>(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ </div><p>(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)

(16:77) Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ </div><p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ </div><p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ </div><p>(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.)

Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements.

They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements.

They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً </div><p>(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ</div><p>(It would in that case be a return with loss.)

Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements.

They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, \"In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ </div><p>(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ</div><p>(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.)

Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ </div><p>(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors.

They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً </div><p>(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ</div><p>(It would in that case be a return with loss.)

The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً </div><p>(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!)

(16:77) Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ </div><p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ </div><p>(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ </div><p>(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.)

(11:99) This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ </div><p>(And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.) (28:41) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى </div><p>(In this is a lesson for whoever fears.)</p>"

As Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ</div><p>(the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind;) (40:57) And His saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَـيْسَ الَذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَى وَهُوَ الْخَلَّـقُ الْعَلِيمُ </div><p>(Is not the One Who created the heavens and the earth, capable of creating the similar to them. Yes, indeed! He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing.) (36:81) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَنَـهَا</div><p>(He constructed) He explains this by His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا </div><p>(He raised its height, and has perfected it.) meaning, He made it a lofty structure, vast in its space, with equal sides, and adorned with stars at night and in the darkness. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا </div><p>(Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He made its night dark and extremely black, and its day bright, luminous, shining and clear. Ibn `Abbas said, \"He did Aghtasha of its night means that He made it dark.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and a large group have said this as well. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا</div><p>(And He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He illuminated its day. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا </div><p>(And after that He spread the earth,) He explains this statement by the statement that follows it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا </div><p>(And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.) It already has been mentioned previously in Surat Ha Mim As-Sajdah that the earth was created before the heaven was created, but it was only spread out after the creation of the heaven. This means that He brought out what was in it with a forceful action. This is the meaning of what was said by Ibn `Abbas and others, and it was the explanation preferred by Ibn Jarir. In reference to the statement of Allah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا </div><p>(And the mountains He has fixed firmly,) meaning, He settled them, made them firm, and established them in their places. And He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing. He is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ </div><p>(As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) meaning, He spread out the earth, caused its springs to gush forth, brought forth its hidden benefits, caused its rivers to flow, and caused its vegetation, trees, and fruits to grow. He also made its mountains firm so that it (the earth) would be calmly settled with its dwellers, and He stabilized its dwelling places. All of this is a means of beneficial enjoyment for His creatures (mankind) providing them of what cattle they need, which they eat and ride upon. He has granted them these beneficial things for the period that they need them, in this worldly abode, until the end of time and the expiration of this life.</p>"

To your Lord it is limited.) meaning, its knowledge is not with you, nor with any creature. Rather the knowledge of it is with Allah. He is the One Who knows the exact time of its occurrence.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً يَسْـَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden. They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah.\") (7:187) Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ </div><p>(To your Lord it is limited.) Thus, when Jibril asked the Messenger of Allah about the time of the last Hour he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»</div><p>(The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرُ مَن يَخْشَـهَا </div><p>(You are only a warner for those who fear it,) meaning, `I sent you to warn mankind and caution them to beware of the torment and punishment of Allah. So whoever fears Allah, fears standing before Him, and His threat, then he will follow you, and thus be successful and victorious. However, whoever denies you and opposes you, then he will only suffer loss and failure.' Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا </div><p>(The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) meaning, when they stand up from their graves to go to the place of Gathering, they will feel that the period of the worldy life was short, it will seem to them that it was only the afternoon of one day. Juwaybir reported from Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا </div><p>(The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) \"As for `Ashiyyah, it is the time between noon until the setting of the sun.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ ضُحَـهَا</div><p>(Or its (Duha) morning) what is between sunrise and midday (noon).\" Qatadah said, \"This refers to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at. And to Allah belongs all praise and thanks.</p>"
