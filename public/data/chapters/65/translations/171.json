      "text": "O Prophet! If you or any of the men from your nation intend to divorce your wives, then he should issue a divorce to her considering her waiting period. That is that the divorce should be issued in a period of purity between two separate menses, in which he has not had sexual relations with her. Also, keep track of the waiting period, so that you are able to take your wives back within it if you intend to do so. And be mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed; do not force your divorced wives out of the homes they live in, until their waiting periods finish, except if they commit an obvious shameful act i.e. adultery. Those are the limits of Allah He has set for His servants; whoever trespasses the limits of Allah has indeed, oppressed himself by placing himself in a situation of doom, because of disobeying his Lord. O divorcée! You do not know, perhaps Allah may create a longing in the heart of the spouse, and he may take his wife back."

And if you intend to either take them back or separate from them, make two honest people from among you witness it to dispel any dispute in future. O witnesses! Give testimony seeking the pleasure of Allah. These laws are mentioned to remind those that bring faith in Allah and in the Day of Judgement, because it is them who truly benefit from reminders and advice. And whoever is mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, Allah will create an exit for him from every difficulty and worry."

Indeed, Allah will make His decision come to pass; nothing makes him incapable nor does He miss anything. He has appointed a fixed time for everything, so the severity and ease both have fixed times; they are never permanent on the human."

Likewise, the waiting period of girls who have not reached the age of puberty and hence do not menstruate, their waiting period will also be three months. As for pregnant women, their waiting period after divorce or being widowed is when they give birth. Whoever is mindful of Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He has not allowed, Allah will make his affairs easy for him and make easy every difficult matter."

House them wherever you yourselves live, according to your means; Allah does not burden you with anything other than that. Do not put any restriction in expenses and shelter upon them, hoping to place them in difficulty. If the divorcée is pregnant, spend on her until she gives birth, and if she breastfeeds your child for you then give her the wage of her breastfeeding. Come to a mutual agreement over the matter of the wage with appropriate courtesy; if the husband shows miserliness in the wage the wife wants, or if she shows greed and is not content with anything except her demands, then the father of the child should hire a foster mother who breastfeeds his child for him."

Allah will soon create abundance and independence after his difficult state."
