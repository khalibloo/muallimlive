A man cannot be an example to be followed unless he shuns the temptation of this world.\" Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ</div><p>(And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things, and preferred them above the nations.

This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ فَرِحُواْ بِمَا عِندَهُمْ مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ</div><p>(Then when their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were glad with that which they had of the knowledge...) (40:83-85) Those who claim that this refers to the conquest of Makkah go too far, and have made a grievous mistake, for on the day of the conquest of Makkah, the Messenger of Allah accepted the Islam of the freed Makkan prisoners-of-war, who numbered nearly two thousand. If what was meant by this Ayah was the conquest of Makkah, he would not have accepted their Islam, because Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يَوْمَ الْفَتْحِ لاَ يَنفَعُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِيَمَـنُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ </div><p>(Say: \"On the Day of Al-Fath, no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.\") What is meant by Al-Fath here is Judgement, as in the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَافْتَحْ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُمْ فَتْحاً</div><p>(Nuh said: So Aftah (judge) between me and them) (26:118). and:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth\") (34:26).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْتَفْتَحُواْ وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ </div><p>(And they sought judgement and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction. ) (14:15)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(although aforetime they had invoked Allah to pass judgement over those who disbelieved) (2:89)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ الْفَتْحُ</div><p>(If you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come unto you) (8:19). Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَانتَظِرْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّنتَظِرُونَ </div><p>(So turn aside from them and await, verily, they (too) are awaiting.) meaning, `turn away from these idolators, and convey that which has been revealed to you from your Lord.' This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اتَّبِعْ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no God but Him.) (6:106) `Wait until Allah fulfills that which He has promised you, and grants you victory over those who oppose you, for He never breaks His promise.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَنْهُمْ وَانتَظِرْ</div><p>(verily, they (too) are awaiting.) means, `you are waiting, and they are waiting and plotting against you,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ شَاعِرٌ نَّتَرَبَّصُ بِهِ رَيْبَ الْمَنُونِ </div><p>(Or do they say: \"A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!\") (52:30). `You will see the consequences of your patience towards them, and the fulfillment of the promise of your Lord in your victory over them, and they will see the consequences of their wait for something bad to befall you and your Companions, in that Allah's punishment will come upon them.' Sufficient unto us is Allah, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat As-Sajdah.</p>"
