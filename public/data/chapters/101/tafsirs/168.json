At this stage, the believers will be separated from the non-believers. Weighing on the second time will be to distinguish between good and evil deeds of the believers.

As for the believers who have performed righteous as well as unrighteous deeds, the Qur'an is generally silent on the issue. However, the principle may be noted that on the Day of Judgment human deeds will not be counted, but weighed.
