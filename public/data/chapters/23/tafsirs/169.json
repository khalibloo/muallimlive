These are the believers who have the following characteristics:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ </div><p>(Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـشِعُونَ</div><p>\"(Khashi`un) means those with fear and with tranquillity.\" This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the Khushu` of the heart. This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Their Khushu` was in their hearts.\" So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others. Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ الطِّيبُ وَالنِّسَاءُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»</div><p>(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُّعْرِضُونَ </div><p>(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.) refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّواْ كِراماً</div><p>(And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity)25:72. Qatadah said: \"By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَـوةِ فَـعِلُونَ </div><p>(And those who pay the Zakah.) Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) 6:141 It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا </div><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) 91:9-10 It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَـفِظُونَ - إِلاَّ عَلَى أَزْوَجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ - فَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَآءَ ذلِكَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ </div><p>(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.) means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives. One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَفَمَنِ ابْتَغَى وَرَآءَ ذلِكَ</div><p>(they are free from blame.

This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا اؤْتُمِنَ خَان»</div><p>(The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَى صَلَوَتِهِمْ يُحَـفِظُونَ </div><p>(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.) means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا»</div><p>(Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن»</div><p>(Kindness to one's parents. ) I said, `Then what' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</div><p>(Jihad in the way of Allah.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: \"At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.\" Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْتَقِيمُوا وَلَنْ تُحْصُوا، وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ خَيْرَ أَعْمَالِكُمُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَلَا يُحَافِظُ عَلَى الْوُضُوءِ إِلَّا مُؤْمِن»</div><p>(Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu' except the believer.) Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ </div><p>(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ الْجَنَّةَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ، فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمن»</div><p>(If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَلَهُ مَنْزِلَانِ: مَنْزِلٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَمَنْزِلٌ فِي النَّارِ، فَإِنْ مَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ وَرِثَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَهُ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">»</div><p>(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.) Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ </div><p>(These are indeed the heirs.) \"The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.\" This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجِيءُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَاسٌ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِذُنُوبٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ،فَيَغْفِرُهَا اللهُ لَهُمْ وَيَضَعُهَا عَلَى الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى»</div><p>(Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.) According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ دَفَعَ اللهُ لِكُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ يَهُودِيًّا أَوْ نَصْرَانِيًّا، فَيُقَالُ: هَذَا فِكَاكُكَ مِنَ النَّار»</div><p>(When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, \"This is your ransom from the Fire.\") `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً </div><p>(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) 19:63</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) 43:72</p>"

As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) 6:141 It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا </div><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) 91:9-10 It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters.

Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.\" This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجِيءُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَاسٌ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِذُنُوبٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ،فَيَغْفِرُهَا اللهُ لَهُمْ وَيَضَعُهَا عَلَى الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى»</div><p>(Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)

Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ الطِّيبُ وَالنِّسَاءُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»</div><p>(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُّعْرِضُونَ </div><p>(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.) refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَلَهُ مَنْزِلَانِ: مَنْزِلٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَمَنْزِلٌ فِي النَّارِ، فَإِنْ مَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ وَرِثَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَهُ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">»</div><p>(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell.

Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.\" This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجِيءُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَاسٌ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِذُنُوبٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ،فَيَغْفِرُهَا اللهُ لَهُمْ وَيَضَعُهَا عَلَى الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى»</div><p>(Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.)

Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else.

According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ دَفَعَ اللهُ لِكُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ يَهُودِيًّا أَوْ نَصْرَانِيًّا، فَيُقَالُ: هَذَا فِكَاكُكَ مِنَ النَّار»</div><p>(When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, \"This is your ransom from the Fire.\") `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً </div><p>(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) 19:63</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) 43:72</p>"

Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else.

If there is a land that needs a lot of water for its irrigation but its fertile soil would be carried away if rain fell on it, then Allah sends water to it from another land, as in the case of Egypt, which is said to be a barren land. Allah sends the water of the Nile to it, which brings red soil from Ethiopia when it rains there. The water brings the red soil which is used to irrigate the land of Egypt, and whatever of it is deposited is used for agriculture, because the land of Egypt is infertile, and most of it is sand. Glory be to the Subtle One, the All-Knowing, the Most Merciful, the Forgiving.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(and We gave it lodging in the earth,) means, `when the water comes down from the clouds, We cause it to settle in the earth, and We cause the earth to absorb it and the seeds etc. in the earth to be nourished by it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ذَهَابٍ بِهِ لَقَـدِرُونَ</div><p>(and verily, We are able to take it away.) means, `if We wanted to cause it not to rain, We could do so; if We wanted to divert it towards the wilderness and wastelands, We could do so; if We wanted to make it salty so that you could not benefit from it for drinking or irrigation, We could do so; if We wanted to cause it not to be absorbed by the earth, but to remain on the surface, We could do so; if We wanted to make it go deep underground where you would not be able to reach it and you could not benefit from it, We could do so.' But by His grace and mercy, He causes sweet, fresh water to fall on you from the clouds, then it settles in the earth and forms springs and rivers, and you use it to irrigate your crops and fruits, and you drink it and give it to your livestock and cattle, and you bathe and purify yourselves with it.

If there is a land that needs a lot of water for its irrigation but its fertile soil would be carried away if rain fell on it, then Allah sends water to it from another land, as in the case of Egypt, which is said to be a barren land. Allah sends the water of the Nile to it, which brings red soil from Ethiopia when it rains there. The water brings the red soil which is used to irrigate the land of Egypt, and whatever of it is deposited is used for agriculture, because the land of Egypt is infertile, and most of it is sand. Glory be to the Subtle One, the All-Knowing, the Most Merciful, the Forgiving.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(and We gave it lodging in the earth,) means, `when the water comes down from the clouds, We cause it to settle in the earth, and We cause the earth to absorb it and the seeds etc. in the earth to be nourished by it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ذَهَابٍ بِهِ لَقَـدِرُونَ</div><p>(and verily, We are able to take it away.) means, `if We wanted to cause it not to rain, We could do so; if We wanted to divert it towards the wilderness and wastelands, We could do so; if We wanted to make it salty so that you could not benefit from it for drinking or irrigation, We could do so; if We wanted to cause it not to be absorbed by the earth, but to remain on the surface, We could do so; if We wanted to make it go deep underground where you would not be able to reach it and you could not benefit from it, We could do so.' But by His grace and mercy, He causes sweet, fresh water to fall on you from the clouds, then it settles in the earth and forms springs and rivers, and you use it to irrigate your crops and fruits, and you drink it and give it to your livestock and cattle, and you bathe and purify yourselves with it. To Him is due the praise and thanks.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَأْنَا لَكُمْ بِهِ جَنَّـتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَـبٍ</div><p>(Then We brought forth for you therewith gardens of date palms and grapes,) means, `from that which We send down from the sky, We bring forth for you gardens and orchards which look beautiful.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ</div><p>(of date palms and grapes,) These were the kinds of gardens that were known to the people of the Hijaz, but there is no difference between a thing and its counterpart. The people of each region have fruits which are the blessing of Allah given to them, and for which they cannot properly thank Allah enough.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّكُمْ فِيهَا فَوَكِهُ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(wherein is much fruit for you,) means, of all fruits. As Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُنبِتُ لَكُمْ بِهِ الزَّرْعَ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالنَّخِيلَ وَالأَعْنَـبَ وَمِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ</div><p>(With it the rain He causes to grow for you the crops, the olives, the date palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit) 16:11.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(and whereof you eat.) This implies that you look at its beauty, wait for it to ripen, then eat from it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ</div><p>(And a tree that springs forth from Tur Sinai,) means the olive tree. Tur means a mountain. Some of the scholars said, \"It is called Tur if there are trees on it, and if it is bare it is called Jabal, not Tur. And Allah knows best. Mount Sinai is the same as Tur Sinin, and it is the mountain on which Allah spoke to Musa bin `Imran, peace be upon him, and in the surrounding mountains there are olive trees.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ</div><p>(that grows oil,) Some scholars think it linguistically means that it brings forth oil. Others say it linguistically means \"comes forth with oil.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَصِبْغٍ</div><p>(and relish) meaning a condiment. according to Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلأَكِلِيِنَ</div><p>(for the eaters. ) means, it contains a beneficial oil and condiment. `Abd bin Humayd recorded in his Musnad and Tafsir from `Umar that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ائْتَدِمُوا بِالزَّيْتِ وَادَّهِنُوا بِهِ فَإِنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ شَجَرَةٍ مُبَارَكَة»</div><p>(Eat (olive) oil as a condiment and apply it as oil, for it comes from a blessed tree.) It was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. Allah's saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى الاٌّنْعَـمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فيِهَا مَنَـفِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ - وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ </div><p>(And verily, in the cattle there is indeed a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies. And there are, in them, numerous benefits for you, and of them you eat. And on them and on ships you are carried), Here Allah mentions the benefits He has given to His servants in cattle, for they drink their milk which comes out from between dung and blood, they eat their meat and clothe themselves with their wool and hair, they ride on their backs and carry heavy burdens on them to far away lands, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَحْمِلُ أَثْقَالَكُمْ إِلَى بَلَدٍ لَّمْ تَكُونُواْ بَـلِغِيهِ إِلاَّ بِشِقِّ الأَنفُسِ إِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَؤُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is full of kindness, Most Merciful.) 16:7</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ - وَذَلَّلْنَـهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ - وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مَنَـفِعُ وَمَشَـرِبُ أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ </div><p>(Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners. And We have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding and some they eat. And in them there are benefits for them, and drink. Will they not then be grateful) 36:71-73</p>"

May Allah reward them with good on behalf of the people.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ</div><p>(Eat of the Tayyibat) Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, \"This means lawful. In the Sahih it says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا رَعَى الْغَنَم»</div><p>(There is no Prophet who was not a shepherd.) They asked, \"And you, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، كُنْتُ أَرْعَاهَا عَلَى قَرَارِيَط لِأَهْلِ مَكَّة»</div><p>(Yes, I used to tend the sheep of the people of Makkah for a few Qirats.) In the Sahih, it says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ دَاوُدَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ كَانَ يَأْكُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِ يَدِه»</div><p>(Dawud, upon him be peace, used to eat from the earnings of his own hand.) It was recorded in Sahih Muslim, Jami` At-Tirmidhi and Musnad Al-Imam Ahmad -- from whom this version comes -- that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّ اللهَ طَيِّبٌ لَا يَقْبَلُ إِلَّا طَيِّبًا، وَإِنَّ اللهَ أَمَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِمَا أَمَرَ بِهِ الْمُرْسَلِين»</div><p>(O people, Allah is Tayyib and only accepts that which is Tayyib, and Allah commands the believers as He had commanded the Messengers by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الرُّسُلُ كُلُواْ مِنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَاعْمَلُواْ صَـلِحاً إِنِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ </div><p>(O Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Acquainted with what you do.) 23:51 and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ</div><p>(O you who believe! Eat of the Tayyibat that We have provided you with)2:172.) Then he mentioned how a man may travel on a long journey, dusty and unkempt,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَطْعَمُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَمَشْرَبُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَمَلْبَسُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَغُذِّيَ بِالْحَرَامِ يَمُدُّ يَدَيْهِ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ: يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ فَأَنَّى يُسْتَجَابُ لِذَلِك»</div><p>(and his food, drink and clothing are unlawful, and he has nourished himself with what is unlawful, and he extends his hands towards the sky, saying, `O Lord, O Lord!' -- how can his prayer be answered.) At-Tirmidhi said that it is \"Hasan Gharib.\"</p><h2>The Religion of all the Prophets is Tawhid; and the Warning against splitting into different Groups</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion is one religion,) means, `your religion, O Prophets, is one religion and one group, which is the call to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate.' Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَاْ رَبُّكُمْ فَاتَّقُونِ</div><p>(and I am your Lord, so have Taqwa.) We have already discussed this in Surat Al-Anbiya'. The phrase</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(one nation) is descriptive.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَقَطَّعُواْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُراً</div><p>(But they have broken their religion among them into sects,) the nations to whom Prophets were sent.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</div><p>(each group rejoicing in what is with it.) means, they rejoice in their misguidance because they think that they are rightly-guided. Allah says, threatening and warning:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ فِى غَمْرَتِهِمْ</div><p>(So, leave them in their error) meaning their misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى حِينٍ</div><p>(for a time.) means, until the appointed time of their destruction comes. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَهِّلِ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْهِلْهُمْ رُوَيْداً </div><p>(So give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.) 86:17 And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْهُمْ يَأْكُلُواْ وَيَتَمَتَّعُواْ وَيُلْهِهِمُ الاٌّمَلُ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(Leave them to eat and enjoy, and let them be preoccupied with (false) hope.

Nay, but they perceive not.) means, `do these deceived people think that what We give them of wealth and children is because they are honored and precious in Our sight No, the matter is not as they claim when they say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ أَكْثَـرُ أَمْوَلاً وَأَوْلَـداً وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ</div><p>(We are more in wealth and in children, and we are not going to be punished.) 34:35 But this thinking is wrong, and their hopes will be dashed. We only give those things to them in order to make them go further (in sin) and to give them more time.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(but they perceive not.) as He says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَلُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ بِهَا فِي الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(So, let not their wealth nor their children amaze you; in reality Allah's plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world...) 9:55</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُواْ إِثْمَاً</div><p>(We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness) 3:178.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْنِى وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَأَمْلَى لَهُمْ</div><p>(Then leave Me Alone with such as belie this Qur'an. We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَخْلَاقَكُمْ كَمَا قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَرْزَاقَكُمْ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ يُعْطِي الدُّنْيَا مَنْ يُحِبُّ وَمَنْ لَا يُحِبُّ، وَلَا يُعْطِي الدِّينَ إِلَّا لِمَنْ أَحَبَّ، فَمَنْ أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ الدِّينَ فَقَدْ أَحَبَّهُ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يُسْلِمُ عَبْدٌ حَتَّى يَسْلَمَ قَلْبُهُ وَلِسَانُهُ، وَلَا يُؤْمِنُ حَتَّى يَأْمَنَ جَارُهُ بَوَائِقَه»</div><p>(Allah has distributed your behavior to you just as He has distritbuted your provision. Allah gives the things of this world to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He only gives religious commitment to those whom He loves. Whoever is given religious commitment by Allah is loved by Him. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no servant truly submits until his heart and his tongue submit, and he does not truly believe until his neighbor is safe from his harm.) They said, `What is his harm, O Messenger of Allah' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«غَشْمُهُ وَظُلْمُهُ، وَلَا يَكْسِبُ عَبْدٌ مَالًا مِنْ حَرَامٍ فَيُنْفِقَ مِنْهُ فَيُبَارَكَ لَهُ فِيهِ، وَلَا يَتَصَدَّقَ بِهِ فَيُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ، وَلَا يَتْرُكَهُ خَلْفَ ظَهْرِهِ إِلَّا كَانَ زَادَهُ إِلَى النَّارِ، إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يَمْحُو السَّيِّءَ بِالسَّيِّءِ وَلَكِنْ يَمْحُو السَّيِّءَ بِالْحَسَنِ، إِنَّ الْخَبِيثَ لَا يَمْحُو الْخَبِيث»</div><p>(His wrongdoing and misbehavior. No person who earns unlawful wealth and spends it will be blessed in that; if he gives it in charity, it will not be accepted from him and if he leaves it behind (when he dies), it will be his provision in the Fire.

What these people, upon whom the blessing had been bestowed, should have done, was to accept it and give thanks for it, and try to understand it and act in accordance with it night and day, as was done by the wise ones among them who became Muslim and followed the Messenger , may Allah be pleased with them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُواْ الْقَوْلَ</div><p>(Have they not pondered over the Word,) Qatadah said, \"Because, by Allah, if the people had pondered the meaning and understood it properly, they would have found in the Qur'an a deterrent to disobeying Allah. But they only paid attention to the Ayat which are not entirely clear, and so they were destroyed because of that.\" Then Allah says, denouncing the disbelievers of the Quraysh:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ لَمْ يَعْرِفُواْ رَسُولَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ </div><p>(Or is it that they did not recognize their Messenger so they deny him) means, `do they not recognize Muhammad and the honesty, trustworthiness and good character with which he grew up among them Can they deny that or argue against it' Ja`far bin Abi Talib said to An-Najashi, the king of Ethiopia: \"O King, Allah has sent to us a Messenger whose lineage, honesty and trustworthiness are known to us.\" Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said something similar to the deputy of Kisra when he wanted to challenge him. When the Byzantine ruler Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and his companions -- who were still disbelievers and had not yet become Muslim -- about the characteristics, lineage, honesty and trustworthiness of the Prophet , they could only tell the truth and admit that he was indeed noble and truthful.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ</div><p>(Or they say: There is madness in him) This is a narration of what the Quraysh said about the Prophet . They said that he was making up the Qur'an by himself, or that he was crazy and did not know what he was saying. Allah tells us that their hearts did not believe that, they knew that what they were saying about the Qur'an was falsehood, for it had come to them from the Words of Allah and could not be resisted or rejected. So Allah challenged them and all the people of the world to produce something like it if they could -- but they could not and would never be able to do so.

This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ </div><p>(Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion.) 8:23</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ</div><p>(And if (Lauw) you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\" Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden.) 6:27-29 Until His statement:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِمَبْعُوثِينَ</div><p>(be resurrected) This has to do with the knowledge of Allah. He knows about some- thing that will not happen, but if it were to happen, He knows how it would be. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Every- thing that is implied in the word:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ</div><p>(If (Lauw)) is something that will never happen.\"</p>"

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَسْـَلُ حَمِيمٌ حَمِيماً يُبَصَّرُونَهُمْ</div><p>(And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition), though they shall be made to see one another) 70:10-11. meaning, no relative will ask about another relative, even if he can see him and even if he is carrying a heavy burden. Even if he was the dearest of people to him in this world, he will not care about him or take even the slightest part of his burden from him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَفِرُّ الْمَرْءُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ - وَأُمِّهِ وَأَبِيهِ - وَصَـحِبَتِهُ وَبَنِيهِ </div><p>(That Day shall a man flee from his brother. And from his mother and his father. And from his wife and his children.) 80:34-36 Ibn Mas`ud said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will gather the first and the last, then a voice will call out, `Whoever is owed something by another, let him come forth and take it.' And a man will rejoice if he is owed something or had been mistreated by his father or child or wife, even if it is little. \" This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ </div><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَزِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </div><p>(Then, those whose Scales are heavy, these! they are the successful.) means, the one whose good deeds outweigh his bad deeds, even by one. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(they are the successful.) means, those who have attained victory and been saved from Hell and admitted to Paradise. Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the ones who have attained what they wanted and been saved from an evil from which there is no escape.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَزِينُهُ</div><p>(And those whose Scales are light,) means, their evil deeds outweigh their good deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُم</div><p>(they are those who lose themselves,) means, they are doomed and have ended up with the worst deal. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(in Hell will they abide. ) meaning, they will stay there forever and will never leave.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَلْفَحُ وُجُوهَهُمُ النَّارُ</div><p>(The Fire will burn their faces,) This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَغْشَى وُجُوهَهُمْ النَّارُ</div><p>(and fire will cover their faces) 14:50. and:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ حِينَ لاَ يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ النَّارَ وَلاَ عَن ظُهُورِهِمْ</div><p>(If only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs) 21:39.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهَا كَـلِحُونَ</div><p>(and therein they will grin, with displaced lips.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn `Abbas, \"Frowning.\"</p>"

He will say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا</div><p>(Remain you in it with ignominy!) meaning, abide therein, humiliated, despised and scorned.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ</div><p>(And speak you not to Me!) means, `do not ask for this again, for I will not respond to you. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ</div><p>(Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) \"These are the words of Ar-Rahman when silencing them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"The people of Hell will call on Malik for forty years, and he will not answer them. Then he will respond and tell them that they are to abide therein. By Allah, their cries will mean nothing to Malik or to the Lord of Malik. Then they will call on their Lord and will say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ </div><p>(Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.) 23:106-107 Allah will not answer them for a time span equivalent to twice the duration of this world. Then He will reply:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ</div><p>(Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) By Allah, the people will not utter a single word after that, and they will merely be in the Fire of Hell, sighing in a high and low tone.

We believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of all who show mercy!\" But you took them for a laughing stock,) meaning, `you made fun of them for calling on Me and praying to Me,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى أَنسَوْكُمْ ذِكْرِى</div><p>(so much so that they made you forget My remembrance) means, your hatred for them made you forget what I would do to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُنْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ تَضْحَكُونَ</div><p>(while you used to laugh at them!) means, at their deeds and worship.
