When they boarded the wooden ship at the time of the storm, it marked the completion of the first stage of their decision. While they had intellectually saved themselves from evil, God saved them from the grim consequences of the Flood which would have been their fate, had they rejected the truth. A man of faith attributes his every success to the blessing of God. Therefore, with each success he thanks God. And the relief afforded from Noah’s flood was clearly an instance of God’s help. At this juncture, the words that spontaneously came out of a believer’s mouth have been recorded in this verse. He admits the  grace of God bestowed upon him and solicits His further blessings in future, because he is sure that the present and future are both in the hands of God.</p>"

In ancient times, the Jews enjoyed the position of being a prophet-raising community. But, having continuously indulged in arrogant behaviour, they forfeited this entitlement. The time had come for this trust to be taken away from them and handed over to another community, in this case, the Children of Ishmael. Therefore, as a way of bringing to a conclusion the religious predominance of the Jews, God caused their last prophet to be born in a miraculous manner and gave him some additional miracles to perform. The Jews, however, persisted in rejecting him, and this finally proved that they did not deserve to be a community into which prophets should be born. This was a very critical moment for the Messiah’s mother, Mary. In these circumstances, she was in dire need of a corner where she could live away from the eyes of the people, and where the necessities of life should be available in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. When Almighty God placed her in this critical position, He also provided for her a peaceful place near her home.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">In these verses, a certain contradiction in thinking has been referred to by which the majority of people in every age have been afflicted. Most people admit that the Creator of the earth and the heavens is the one and only God; that He is their Lord and He controls them; that He enjoys all the superior powers. Yet their lives do not in any way reflect this acknowledgement. Such sublime truth demands that it permeates their thinking. The realisation of God should make them truly God-conscious. It should so become a part of their nature that, when they come face to face with the Truth, they admit it immediately. Their whole life should be moulded upon it. But, in actual fact, none of this happens. They accept God as a formal belief, but their real lives are not affected by it. The conception of God does not cast any spell over such individuals. On the contrary, they remain enamoured of trivial things. How strange is man’s behaviour!</p>"
