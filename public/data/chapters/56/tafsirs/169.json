The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</div><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ </div><p>(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</p>"

Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ </div><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right!

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً </div><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</div><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.)

Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً </div><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</div><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not.

A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)!

(88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech.

(88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.)

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً </div><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.)

He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger :</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</div><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</div><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</div><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</div><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ </div><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ </div><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ </div><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ </div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</div><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ </div><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً </div><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</div><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full.

Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.)

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me.

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.)

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.)

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.)

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full.

Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me.

Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</div><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.)

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</div><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger!

When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</div><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.)

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.)

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh.

Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.)

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).)

The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it.

The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it.

The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it.

The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.)

The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</div><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</div><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</div><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord!

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger!

Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right.

And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me.

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger!

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.)

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.)

Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.

      "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ </div><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</div><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْضُودٍ</div><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ </div><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ </div><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</div><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</div><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</div><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</div><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</div><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</div><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</div><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</div><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</div><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</div><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ </div><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ </div><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </div><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ </div><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</div><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</div><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</div><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً</div><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَاباً</div><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</div><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full.

Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</div><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me.

Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</div><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</div><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</div><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>"

Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones.

Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night.

Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>"

Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.) meaning, `this is a great vow that I -- Allah -- am making; if you knew the greatness of this vow, you will know the greatness of the subject of the vow,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.) means, verily, this Qur'an that was revealed to Muhammad is a Glorious Book,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ </div><p>(In a Book Maknun.) meaning glorious; in a glorious, well-guarded, revered Book.

Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an.

Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry. Rather it is the truth, no doubt about it; there is none beyond it of useful truth. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi. Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّدْهِنُونَ</div><p>(Mudhinun) means \"You want to fill yourselves with and rely upon.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(And you make your provision your denial!) some of them said that provision here has the meaning of gratitude, meaning: you deny without any gratitude. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he recited it as: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And your show of your gratitude by denying!) Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night.

Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>"

Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an.

Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry.

Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi.

Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night.

Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>"

However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ </div><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an. Allah the Exalted stated that only the pure ones touch the Qur'an, as He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تَنَزَّلَتْ بِهِ الشَّيَـطِينُ - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُمْ وَمَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ - إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ </div><p>(And it is not the Shayatin who have brought it down. Neither would it suit them nor they can (produce it). Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.)(26:210-212)\" This saying is a good saying, and does not contradict those before it. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry. Rather it is the truth, no doubt about it; there is none beyond it of useful truth. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi. Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّدْهِنُونَ</div><p>(Mudhinun) means \"You want to fill yourselves with and rely upon.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(And you make your provision your denial!) some of them said that provision here has the meaning of gratitude, meaning: you deny without any gratitude. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he recited it as: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And your show of your gratitude by denying!) Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the congregation and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟»</div><p>(Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)) Those present replied, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ، فَذلِكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذلِكَ كَافِرٌ بِي وَمُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»</div><p>(Allah has said, \"During this morning some of my servants remained as true believers in Me and some became disbelievers. Whoever said that the rain was due to the blessings and the mercy of Allah, had belief in Me, and he disbelieves in the stars; and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star, had no belief in Me, but believes in that star.\")\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, all using a chain of narration in which Imam Malik was included. Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2><p>These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death. Either they are among the near believers or those below their rank on the right, or those who denied the truth, were led astray from the guidance and were ignorant about Allah. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ</div><p>(Then if he), in reference to the dying person,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ</div><p>(be of the Muqarrabun) who fulfilled the obligations and the recommended acts of worship and avoided the forbidden and disliked matters and even some of the allowed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ </div><p>(then for him Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.) Theirs will be Rawh and Rayhan; and the glad tidings of these traits will be conveyed to them by the angels at the time of death. We mentioned before the Prophet's Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' in which the angels of mercy say (to a dying, believing person),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَه، اخْرُجِي إِلَى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»</div><p>(O good soul in the good body that you inhabited, come to Rawh, Rayhan and a Lord Who is not angry.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Rawh means rest, and Rayhan means place of rest.\" Mujahid said similarly that Rawh means rest. Abu Hazrah said that Rawh means: \"Rest from the world.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that it means to rejoice. And from Mujahid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ</div><p>(Rawh and Rayhan) means: \"Paradise and delights.\" Qatadah said that Rawh means mercy. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning. The near believers who die will earn all of these; mercy, rest, provision, joy, happiness and good delights,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</div><p>(and a Garden of Delights.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»</div><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»</div><p>(He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.) The people around him started weeping, and he asked them why they wept. They said, `All of us hate death.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ ذَاكَ، وَلكِنَّهُ إِذَا احْتُضِرَ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ </div><p>فَإِذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، وَاللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلِقَائِهِ أَحَبُّ</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ،وَاللهُ تَعَالَى لِلِقَائِهِ أَكْرَه»</div><p>(It does not mean that. When one dies: (Then, if he be of the near believers, then for him are Rawh, Rayhan, and a Garden of Delights.)( and when this good news is conveyed to him, he likes to meet Allah the Exalted and Most Honored and Allah the Exalted and Most Honored likes, even more, to meet him, (But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim. And entry in Hellfire.)( and when this news is conveyed to him, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates, even more, to meet him.)\" This is the narration that Imam Ahmad collected; and in the Sahih, there is a Hadith with this meaning collected from `A'ishah. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(And if he be of those on the right,) means, if he, the dying person, is among those on the right,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَلَـمٌ لَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Then Salam (peace) to you from those on the right) meaning, the angels will deliver the good news to them by saying, \"Peace be upon you,\" i.e., be calm, you will be led to safety, you are among those on the right, as `Ikrimah said, \"The angels will greet him with the Salam and convey to him the news that he is among those on the right. \" This is a good explanation, and it conforms with Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ </div><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah.\" and then they stand firm, on them the angles will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32). Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ </div><p>(But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim (boiling water) and entry in Hellfire.) meaning, if the dying person is one of those who denied the truth, who were led astray from guidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنُزُلٌ</div><p>(then for him is an entertainment,) meaning, as a guest</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْ حَمِيمٍ</div><p>(with Hamim) that dissolves his intestines and skin,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ </div><p>(And entry in Hellfire.) he will reside in Hellfire, which will engulf him from every direction. Allah the Exalted said, next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ حَقُّ الْيَقِينِ </div><p>(Verily, this! This is an absolute truth with certainty.) meaning, this news is the truth; there is no doubt about it, nor escape from it for anyone,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ </div><p>(So, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَالَ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، غُرِسَتْ لَهُ نَخْلَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(He who says, \"Glory be to Allah the Magnificent and with His praise!\" then a date tree will be planted for him in Paradise.) This Hadith was collected by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded in his book (Sahih) that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمنِ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيم»</div><p>((There are) two statements that are light on the tongue, but heavy on the Balance, and most beloved to Ar-Rahman: \"Glory be to Allah and with His praise, glory be to Allah the Magnificent.\") The Group, with the exception of Abu Dawud, collected this.
