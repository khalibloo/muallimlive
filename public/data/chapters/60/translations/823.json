Would you show them affection when they have rejected the truth you have received; when they have driven you and the Messenger out [simply] because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have left your homes to strive for My cause and out of a desire to seek My goodwill, how can you secretly offer them friendship?  I know all that you conceal and all that you reveal. Whoever of you does this will surely stray from the right path."

Enmity and hatred shall endure between us and you, until you believe in the one God.’ [The exception was] when Abraham said to his father, ‘I shall indeed pray for [God’s] forgiveness for you; although I do not have it in my power to obtain anything from God on your behalf.’ They prayed, ‘O our Lord, in You we have placed our trust and to You we turn in repentance and to You is the final return."

Then if you find them to be true believers, do not send them back to those who deny the truth. These [women] are not lawful for them, nor are those who deny the truth lawful for these women. But hand back to those who deny the truth the dowers they gave them; nor is it an offence for you to marry such women, provided you give them their dowers. Do not maintain your marriages with those women who deny the truth: demand repayment of the dowers you have given them and let the disbelievers ask for the return of what they have spent. Such is God’s judgement; He judges with justice between you. God is all knowing and all wise."
