They were from the Jews: the people of the Torah. After they had broken their treaty and sided with the idolaters against the Messenger, He exiled them towards the Levant. O believers! You did not think they would leave their homes because of the might and strength they possessed, and they themselves thought that their fortresses they had fortified would protect them from the might of Allah and His punishment. Then, the might of Allah came upon them in a manner they did not anticipate, when He commanded His Messenger to fight them and exile them from their homes. Allah also put extreme fear into their hearts, and they began demolishing their homes with their own hands from the inside so that the believers could not take advantage of them, while the Muslims demolished them from the outside. O people of insight! So take heed of what befell them due to their disbelief and do not be like them, in case you get the same requital as they did, and face the same punishment they faced."

Whatever date palm you cut down to infuriate the enemies of Allah in the battle of the Banū an-Naḍīr, or you left it standing with its trunk to make use of it, was done with the command of Allah; it was not done to cause destruction on earth like they claimed. It was also done so that Allah could humiliate through it those who left the obedience of Allah from the Jews: those that broke the treaties and chose the path of treason over the path of loyalty."

This distribution is so that the wealth is not only confined to the rich rather than the poor. O believers! Whatever wealth of the Fay’ the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he does not allow you to take, then refrain from it.

They give priority to the Migrants over themselves in worldly shares, even though they themselves are needy and poor.
