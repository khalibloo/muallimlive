This is the subject what is being sworn about, and it means that he (man) is ungrateful for the favors of His Lord and he rejects them. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Abu Al-Jawza', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Ad-Duha, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Qays, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said, \"Al-Kanud means ungrateful.\" Al-Hasan said, \"Al-Kanud is the one who counts the calamities (that befall him) and he forgets Allah's favors.\"</p><h2>Concerning Allah's statement,</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ عَلَى ذَلِكَ لَشَهِيدٌ </div><p>(And to that He bears witness.) Qatadah and Sufyan Ath-Thawri both said, \"And indeed Allah is a witness to that.\" It is also possible that the pronoun (He) could be referring to man. This was said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Thus, its meaning would be that man is a witness himself to the fact that he is ungrateful. This is obvious in his condition, meaning this is apparent from his statements and deeds. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُواْ مَسَاجِدَ الله شَـهِدِينَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِم بِالْكُفْرِ</div><p>(It is not for the idolators, to maintain the Masajid of Allah, while they witness disbelief against themselves.) (9:17) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ </div><p>(And verily, he is violent in the love of wealth.) meaning, and indeed in his love of the good, which is wealth, he is severe. There are two opinions concerning this. One of them is that it means that he is severe. There are two opinions concerning this. One of them is that it means that he is severe in his love of wealth.

This is just as the Messenger of Allah used to perform raids in the early morning. He would wait to see if he heard the Adhan (call to prayer) from the people. If he heard it he would leave them alone, and if he didn't hear it he would attack. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعاً </div><p>(And raise the dust in clouds the while.) meaning, dust at the place of the battle with the horses.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعاً </div><p>(And penetrating forthwith as one into the midst.) means, then are all in the middle of that spot, together.
