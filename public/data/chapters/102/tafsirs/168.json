[ Mazhari with reference to Hakim and Baihagi on the authority of Ibn Umar ].</p><p>Warning Against Materialistic Attitude</p><p>Verse [ 1] أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ‌ (You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing [ worldly benefits ].) The word takathur is derived from the root kathrah, and means 'to amass much wealth'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Hasan Basri (رح) have assigned this interpretation to it. Qatadah\tرحمۃ اللہ علیہ says that this word is also used in the sense of 'taking pride in the abundance of material goods'. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ reports that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this verse and explained its meaning, thus: \"Acquiring wealth but not paying out of it the obligatory dues.\" [ Qurtubi ].</p>"

Referring to verse [ 2] of this Surah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: حَتّٰی یِأتیکُم الموت \"until death overtakes you\" [ Ibn Kathir, from by Ibn Abi Hatim ]. The verse thus implies that many people are engrossed in acquiring worldly goods and racing each other in wealth and children etc. and remain neglectful of the Hereafter till death comes upon them, and then they are seized by the divine punishment. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Shikhkhir ؓ reports that one day he visited the Holy Prophet ﷺ while the latter was reciting Surah At-Takathur and was saying:</p><p>یقُول ابن اٰدم مالی مالی و ھل لک من مالک الَّا ما اکلت فافنیت او لبست فابلیت اوتصدّقت فامضیت، وفی روایۃ لمسلم وما سویٰ ذلک فذاھب و تارکہ للناس</p><p>\"The Son of Adam says: 'My wealth, my wealth.'

As a result, some of the Companions were under the impression that the Prophetic words were part of the Qur'an. Later on, when the Surah was recited in its entirety, it did not contain the Prophetic words.

Allah informed him about this while he was still on the mountain. This piece of information did not affect Musa (علیہ السلام) so much. However, when he returned and saw the Children of Israel, with his own eyes, worshipping the calf, he became so indignant that the tablets of Torah involuntarily fell from his hands.
