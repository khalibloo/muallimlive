Say to them, O Messenger: You will never follow us to those spoils, because Allah has promised us that the spoils of Khaybar are only for those who were present at Hudaibiyya. They will say: Your preventing us from following you to Khaybar is not an instruction from Allah, but because you are jealous of us. The matter is not as these people who were left behind claim. Rather, they do not understand Allah’s instructions and prohibitions except a little, and therefore they have fallen into going against Him."

They haughtily rejected the entrance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) into Makkah the year of the treaty of Ḥudaybīyyah, fearing and blaming him that he would overpower them and take control over it. Therefore, Allah sent down tranquility from Himself upon the His Messenger and upon the believers so their anger did not lead to them confronting the idolaters with the same actions. Allah made the believers firm upon the statement of truth, i.e. ‘There is none worthy of worship except for Allah’, and kept them firm upon fulfilling its rights which they fulfilled. The believers were more worthy of this statement than others, and more deserving of it because of the goodness within their hearts that Allah knew of. And Allah is aware of everything; nothing is hidden from Him."

O believers! Allah knows some advantages that you did not know of, and so instead of making the dream a reality by letting you enter Makkah that year, He will give you a victory in the near future i.e. the signing of the treaty of Ḥudaybīyyah and the conquest of Khaybar that followed it at the hands of the believers who had witnessed Ḥudaybīyyah."

You will see them bowing and prostrating, seeking from Allah that He grace them with forgiveness, a generous reward and that He becomes pleased with them. Their mark is on their faces as a result of prostrating in obedience to Allah. That is how they have been described by the Torah: the book that was revealed to Moses (peace be upon him). As for their mention in the Gospel which was revealed to Jesus, it is that they are likened in their assisting one another and perfection like crops that have emerged as small, then strengthened and stood straight up, pleasing the farmers with their strength and perfection. It is so that the disbelievers are angered by the strength, steadfastness and perfection they see within them. And Allah has promised those of the companions who have faith in Him and do good deeds forgiveness for their sins - they will not be taken to account over them, and a great reward from Himself i.e. Paradise."
