Once you have subdue them, tie the chains of the captives. When you capture them you have the option, as per the demand of interests, of being graceful to them by releasing them for no ransom, ransoming them for wealth or something else, killing them, or enslaving them. Continue fighting and capturing them until the war ends by the disbelievers’ accepting Islam or by your entering into a treaty with them. The mentioned trial of the believers with the disbelievers, the alternation of fortunes and the victory of one over the other, is Allah’s decision. If Allah willed to defeat the disbelievers without a fight, He would have done so, but He ordained striving in His path to test some of you with others. He tests who of the believers fights and who doesn’t. He tests the disbeliever with the believer: If the believer is killed he enters Paradise and if the believer kills him he enters the fire. Those who are killed in Allah’s path, Allah will never nullify their deeds."
