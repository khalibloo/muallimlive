And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى </div><p>(Musa said: \"O my Lord!

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى أَنِ ائْتَ الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ - قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ - قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ - وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِى وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِى فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَى هَـرُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ </div><p>(And when your Lord called Musa: \"Go to the people who are wrongdoers.

And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\") So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى </div><p>(Musa said: \"O my Lord!

As-Suddi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يمُوسَى - قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى </div><p>((Fir`awn) said: \"Who then, O Musa, is the Lord of you two\" He said: \"Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.\") (20:49-50) Those among the philosophers and others who claimed that this was a question about the nature or substance of Allah are mistaken. Fir`awn did not believe in the Creator in the first place, so he was in no position to ask about the nature of the Creator; he denied that the Creator existed at all, as is apparent from the meaning, even though proof and evidence had been established against him. When Fir`awn asked him about the Lord of Al-`Alamin, Musa said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ</div><p>((Musa) said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them...\") meaning, the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of all that, their God Who has no partner or associate. He is the One Who has created all things. He knows the higher realms and the heavenly bodies that are in them, both those that are stationary and those that move and shine brightly. He knows the lower realms and what is in them; the oceans, continents, mountains, trees, animals, plants and fruits. He knows what is in between the two realms; the winds, birds, and whatever is in the air. All of them are servants to Him, submitting and humbling themselves before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ</div><p>(if you seek to be convinced with certainty. ) means, if you have believing hearts and clear insight. At this, Fir`awn turned to the chiefs and leaders of his state around him, and said to them -- mockingly expressing his disbelief in Musa:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ</div><p>(\"Do you not hear\") meaning, `are you not amazed by what this man is claiming -- that you have another god other than me' Musa said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!) meaning, the One Who created you and your forefathers, those who came before Fir`awn and his time.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>(He said) that is, Fir`awn said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ الَّذِى أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ</div><p>(Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!) meaning, there is no sense in his claim that there is any god other than me!'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>((Musa) said) -- to those in whose hearts Fir`awn had planted doubts:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!) `He is the One Who made the east the place where the heavenly bodies rise, and made the west the place where they set; this is the system to which He has subjugated all the heavenly bodies, stationary and moving. If what Fir`awn claims is true, that he is your lord and your god, then let him turn things around so that the heavenly bodies set in the east and rise in the west.' This is similar to the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ</div><p>(who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom When Ibrahim said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim said, \"Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east. So cause it to rise from the west.\") (2:258) So when Fir`awn was defeated in debate, he resorted to the use of his force and power, believing that this would be effective in dealing with Musa, peace be upon him, so he said, as Allah tells us:</p>"

So cause it to rise from the west.\") (2:258) So when Fir`awn was defeated in debate, he resorted to the use of his force and power, believing that this would be effective in dealing with Musa, peace be upon him, so he said, as Allah tells us:</p>"

So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَئِنِ اتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـهَاً غَيْرِى لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ الْمَسْجُونِينَ</div><p>(If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.) To this, Musa responded:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكَ بِشَىءٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(Even if I bring you something manifest) meaning, clear and definitive proof.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ فَأْتِ بِهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ - فَأَلْقَى عَصَـهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Fir`awn said: \"Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!\" So he threw his stick, and behold, it was a serpent, manifest.) meanig, it was very clear and obvious, with a huge body and a big mouth, terrifying in appearance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ</div><p>(And he drew out his hand,) meaning, from his sleeve,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا هِىَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّـظِرِينَ</div><p>(and behold, it was white to all beholders!) It was shining like a piece of the moon. Since Fir`awn was already doomed, he hastened to stubborn denial, and said to the chiefs around him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَسَـحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, this is indeed a well-versed sorcerer.) One who knows a great deal of magic or witchcraft. Fir`awn was trying to convince them that this was sorcery, not a miracle.

So they went back to their places:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ</div><p>(They said: \"O Musa!

At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ</div><p>(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ</div><p>(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123).</p>"

They said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ </div><p>(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ</div><p>(They said: \"O Musa!

At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ</div><p>(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ</div><p>(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123).</p>"

So Musa, peace be upon him, did as he was commanded by his Lord, may He be glorified, and he led them forth after they had borrowed an abundance of jewelry from the people of Fir`awn. As more than one of the scholars of Tafsir have said, they left when the moon was rising, and Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said that the moon was eclipsed that night. And Allah knows best. Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf (Prophet Joseph), peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them. The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir`awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed.

So Allah commanded Musa, peace be upon him, to take the Children of Israel out of Egypt by night, and take them wherever he would be commanded. So Musa, peace be upon him, did as he was commanded by his Lord, may He be glorified, and he led them forth after they had borrowed an abundance of jewelry from the people of Fir`awn. As more than one of the scholars of Tafsir have said, they left when the moon was rising, and Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said that the moon was eclipsed that night. And Allah knows best. Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf (Prophet Joseph), peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them. The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir`awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed.

Ibrahim will say to him, \"Did I not tell you not to disobey me\" His father will say to him: \"Today I will not disobey you.\" Ibrahim will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state\" Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\" Then it will be said: \"O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.\" So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.)

Mujahid said, \"This means, they will be hurled into it.\" Others said: \"They will be thrown on top of one another, the disbelievers and their leaders who called them to Shirk. \"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجُنُودُ إِبْلِيسَ أَجْمَعُونَ </div><p>(And all of the hosts of Iblis together.) they will all be thrown into it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ وَهُمْ فِيهَا يَخْتَصِمُونَ - تَاللَّهِ إِن كُنَّا لَفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ - إِذْ نُسَوِّيكُمْ بِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(They will say while contending therein, \"By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error, when we held you as equals with the Lord of all that exists.\") The weak ones among them will say to their arrogant leaders: `Verily, we were following you; can you avail us anything from the Fire' Then they will realize that themselves are to blame and will say: a</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَاللَّهِ إِن كُنَّا لَفِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ - إِذْ نُسَوِّيكُمْ بِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error, when we held you as equals with the Lord of all that exists.) meaning, `we obeyed your commands as we should have obeyed the commands of the Lord of the all that exits, and we worshipped you along with the Lord of all that exits.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَضَلَّنَآ إِلاَّ الْمُجْرِمُونَ </div><p>(And none has brought us into error except the criminals.) meaning, `nobody called us to do that except the evildoers.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا لَنَا مِن شَـفِعِينَ </div><p>(Now we have no intercessors.)

They will wish that they could come back to this world so that they could do deeds of obedience to their Lord -- as they claim -- but Allah knows that if they were to come back to this world, they would only go back to doing forbidden things, and He knows that they are liars. Allah tells us in Surah Sad about how the people of Hell will argue with one another, as He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَحَقٌّ تَخَاصُمُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ </div><p>(Verily, that is the very truth -- the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!) (38:64) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.) meaning, in the dispute of Ibrahim with his people and his proof of Tawhid there is a sign, i.e., clear evidence that there is no God but Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ </div><p>(yet most of them are not believers.

      "text": "<h2>Hud's preaching to His People `Ad</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Hud, when he called his people `Ad. His people used to live in the Ahqaf, curved sand-hills near Hadramawt, on the borders of Yemen. They lived after the time of Nuh, as Allah says in Surat Al-A`raf:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً</div><p>(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature) (7:69). This refers to the fact that they were physically strong and well-built, and very violent, and very tall; they had also been given a great deal of provisions, wealth, gardens, rivers, sons, crops and fruits. Yet despite all of that, they worshipped others besides Allah. So Allah sent Hud, one of their own, as a Messenger bringing them good news and delivering warnings. He called them to worship Allah alone, and he warned them of Allah's wrath and punishment if they were to go against him and treating him harshly. He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ </div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`.

In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً</div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَعْبَثُونَ</div><p>(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ </div><p>(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ</div><p>(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ </div><p>(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ </div><p>(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.' Then Hud began reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ الَّذِى أَمَدَّكُمْ بِمَا تَعْلَمُونَ - أَمَدَّكُمْ بِأَنْعَـمٍ وَبَنِينَ - وَجَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And have Taqwa of Him, Who has aided you with all that you know. He has aided you with cattle and children, and gardens and springs. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) meaning, `if you disbelieve and oppose (your Prophet).' So he called them to Allah with words of encouragement and words of warning, but it was to no avail.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَوَعَظْتَ أَمْ لَمْ تَكُنْ مِّنَ الْوَعِظِينَ - إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ خُلُقُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ </div>"

Allah's saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold. Thus the means of their destruction was suited to their nature, for they were the strongest and fiercest of people, so Allah overpowered them with something that was even stronger and fiercer than them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ </div><p>(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad of Iram Possesors of the pillars) (89:6-7).

Allah's Prophet Salih made them promise that if he responded to their request, they would believe in him and follow him. So they agreed to that. The Prophet of Allah Salih, peace be upon him, stood and prayed, then he prayed to Allah to grant them their request.

Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94).

They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94).

If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ</div><p>(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers.

Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ</div><p>(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them.

Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers.

Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them.

Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers.

Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</div><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ </div><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَثِيمٍ</div><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral.

      "text": "<h2>Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators</h2><p>Here Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</div><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ </div><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَثِيمٍ</div><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</div><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</div><p>(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»</div><p>(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»</div><p>(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»</div><p>(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)</p><h2>Refutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ </div><p>(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ </div><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ </div><p>(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah , two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)</p><h2>The Exception of the Poets of Islam</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ </div><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah , weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتُم»</div><p>((This means) you.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً</div><p>(and remember Allah much). He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتُم»</div><p>((This means) you.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</div><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتُم»</div><p>((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah . He began to praise the Messenger of Allah where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</div><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said to Hassan:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اهْجُهُم»</div><p>(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»</div><p>(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»</div><p>(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</div><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ</div><p>(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</div><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others. This is the end of the Tafsir Surat Ash-Shu`ara'. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.</p>"
