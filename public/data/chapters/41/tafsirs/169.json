This was also the view of `Ikrimah. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا </div><p>(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself. And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) (91:9-10) And;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن تَزَكَّى - وَذَكَرَ اسْمَ رَبِّهِ فَصَلَّى </div><p>(Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success. And remembers (glorifies) the Name of his Lord, and prays.) (87:14-15) And;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَى أَن تَزَكَّى </div><p>(And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself\") (79:18) What is meant by Zakah here is purification of the soul, ridding oneself of all bad qualities, the worst of which is Shirk. The Zakah paid on one's wealth is so called because it purifies wealth, and it is a means of increasing it, blessing it and making it more beneficial, and a means of assisting one to use it in doing good deeds. Qatadah said, \"They withheld the Zakah of their wealth.\" This is the apparent meaning according to many of the scholars of Tafsir, and this is the view favored by Ibn Jarir. But the matter is subject to further examination, because the obligation of Zakah was instituted during the second year after the Hijrah to Al-Madinah, according to what is stated by several scholars. Yet this Ayah was revealed in Makkah. However, it is not unlikely that the principle of giving charity and Zakah was already in place and had been enjoined at the beginning of the Prophet's mission, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest) (6:141). As for the details of Zakah and how it is to be calculated according to the Nusub, were explained in Al-Madinah. This is how we may reconcile between the two opinions. Similarly, prayer was originally enjoined before sunrise and before sunset at the beginning of the Prophet's mission; it was only on the Night of the Isra', a year and a half before the Hijrah, that Allah enjoined upon His Messenger the five daily prayers. The conditions and essential elements of prayer were explained later, in stages. And Allah knows best. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ </div><p>(Truly, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them will be an endless reward that will never stop.) Mujahid and others said, \"It will never be cut off or decrease.\" This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًا </div><p>(They shall abide therein for ever.) (18:3)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</div><p>(a gift without an end) (11:108)</p>"

However, it is not unlikely that the principle of giving charity and Zakah was already in place and had been enjoined at the beginning of the Prophet's mission, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest) (6:141).

(79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ</div><p>(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ </div><p>(And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثاً</div><p>(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something.

Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَحَـهَا</div><p>((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ</div><p>((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</div><p>(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23).

Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَحَـهَا</div><p>((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَلَقَ الاٌّرْضَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ</div><p>((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</div><p>(verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23).

I mentioned this to the Prophet , then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُكُمْ وَلاَ جُلُودُكُمْ</div><p>(And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you) until;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ</div><p>(of those utterly lost!) This is how it was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن يَصْبِرُواْ فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ </div><p>(Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.) means, whether they bear it patiently or not, they are in the Fire and they will have no escape or way out from it, and even if they try to please Allah and offer excuses, nothing of that will be accepted from them. Ibn Jarir said, \"The meaning of the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ</div><p>(and if they seek to please Allah,) is: They will ask to go back to this world, but this plea will not be answered. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ - قَالَ اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ </div><p>(They will say: \"Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.\" He will say: \"Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!\")\" (23:106-108).</p>"

He is not one of those who enjoin good but do not do it themselves, or who forbid evil yet they do it themselves. He does good and avoids doing evil, and he calls people to their Creator, may He be blessed and exalted. This is general in meaning and applies to everyone who calls people to what is good and is himself guided by what he says. The Messenger of Allah is the foremost among people in this regard, as Muhammad bin Sirin, As-Suddi and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said. It was also said that what was meant here is the righteous Mu'adhdhin, as it was mentioned in Sahih Muslim:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(The Mu'adhdhins will be the ones with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.)\" In As-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْإِمَامُ ضَامِنٌ، وَالْمُؤَذِّنُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ، فَأَرْشَدَ اللهُ الْأَئِمَّةَ وَغَفَرَ لِلْمُؤَذِّنِين»</div><p>(The Imam is a guarantor and the Mu'adhdhin is in a position of trust. May Allah guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhin.)\" The correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, and includes the Mu'adhdhin and others. When this Ayah was revealed, the Adhan had not been prescribed at all. The Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and the Adhan was prescribed in Al-Madinah after the Hijrah, when it was shown to `Abdullah bin `Abd Rabbihi Al-Ansari in a dream. He told the Messenger of Allah about it, and he told him to teach it to Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him, who had a more beautiful voice, as we have discussed elsewhere. So the correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, as `Abdur-Razzaq said, narrating from Ma`mar, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, who recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\") and said, \"This is the beloved of Allah, this is the close friend of Allah, this is the chosen one of Allah, this is the most beloved of the all the people of earth to Allah.

Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ</div><p>(But none is granted it except those who are patient) meaning, no one accepts this advice and works according to it, except for those who can be patient in doing so, for it is difficult for people to do.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, the one who has a great portion of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas explained this Ayah: \"Allah commands the believers to be patient when they feel angry, to be forbearing when confronted with ignorance, and to forgive when they are mistreated.

If you seek refuge with Allah and turn to Him, He will stop him from harming you and bring his efforts to naught.

      "text": "<h2>The Virtue of calling Others to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah,) means, he calls the servants of Allah to Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</div><p>(and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\") means, he himself follows that which he says, so it benefits him as well as others. He is not one of those who enjoin good but do not do it themselves, or who forbid evil yet they do it themselves. He does good and avoids doing evil, and he calls people to their Creator, may He be blessed and exalted. This is general in meaning and applies to everyone who calls people to what is good and is himself guided by what he says. The Messenger of Allah is the foremost among people in this regard, as Muhammad bin Sirin, As-Suddi and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said. It was also said that what was meant here is the righteous Mu'adhdhin, as it was mentioned in Sahih Muslim:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(The Mu'adhdhins will be the ones with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.)\" In As-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْإِمَامُ ضَامِنٌ، وَالْمُؤَذِّنُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ، فَأَرْشَدَ اللهُ الْأَئِمَّةَ وَغَفَرَ لِلْمُؤَذِّنِين»</div><p>(The Imam is a guarantor and the Mu'adhdhin is in a position of trust. May Allah guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhin.)\" The correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, and includes the Mu'adhdhin and others. When this Ayah was revealed, the Adhan had not been prescribed at all. The Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and the Adhan was prescribed in Al-Madinah after the Hijrah, when it was shown to `Abdullah bin `Abd Rabbihi Al-Ansari in a dream. He told the Messenger of Allah about it, and he told him to teach it to Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him, who had a more beautiful voice, as we have discussed elsewhere. So the correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, as `Abdur-Razzaq said, narrating from Ma`mar, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, who recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِى مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\") and said, \"This is the beloved of Allah, this is the close friend of Allah, this is the chosen one of Allah, this is the most beloved of the all the people of earth to Allah. He responded to the call of Allah and called mankind to that to which he had responded. He did righteous deeds in response and said, `I am one of the Muslims.' This is Allah's Khalifah.\"</p><h2>Wisdom in Da`wah etc</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَسْتَوِى الْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ السَّيِّئَةُ</div><p>(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal.) means, there is a huge difference between them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ</div><p>(Repel (the evil) with one which is better,) means, `when someone does you wrong, repel him by treating him well,' as `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"There is no better punishment for one who has disobeyed Allah with regard to you, than your obeying Allah with regard to him.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا الَّذِى بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِىٌّ حَمِيمٌ</div><p>(then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.) means, `if you treat well those who treat you badly, this good deed will lead to reconciliation, love and empathy, and it will be as if he is a close friend to you and he will feel pity for you and be kind to you.' Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ</div><p>(But none is granted it except those who are patient) meaning, no one accepts this advice and works according to it, except for those who can be patient in doing so, for it is difficult for people to do.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظِّ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, the one who has a great portion of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas explained this Ayah: \"Allah commands the believers to be patient when they feel angry, to be forbearing when confronted with ignorance, and to forgive when they are mistreated. If they do this, Allah will save them from the Shaytan and subdue their enemies to them until they become like close friends.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِمَّا يَنَزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah.) means, the devils among men may be deceived by your kind treatment of him, but the devils among the Jinn, when they insinuate their evil whispers, cannot be dealt with except by seeking refuge with the Creator Who gave him power over you. If you seek refuge with Allah and turn to Him, He will stop him from harming you and bring his efforts to naught.
