This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created.

Thus, He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّمَآءِ وَالطَّارِقِ </div><p>(By the heaven, and At-Tariq;) Then He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ </div><p>(And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is) Then He explains it by His saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ </div><p>(The star of Ath-Thaqib.) Qatadah and others have said, \"The star has been named Tariq because it is only seen at night and it is hidden during the day.\" His view is supported by what has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith that prohibits a man to come to his family Taruq. This means that he comes to them unexpectedly at nighttime. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الثَّاقِبُ</div><p>(Ath-Thaqib.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"The illuminating.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is illuminating and it burns the Shaytan\" Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ </div><p>(There is no human being but has a protector over him.) meaning, every soul has a guardian over it from Allah that protects it from the calamities. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ مُعَقِّبَـتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(For Him, there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.) (13:11)</p><h2>How Man is created is a Proof of Allah's Ability to Return Him to Him</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلْيَنظُرِ الإِنسَـنُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ </div><p>(So, let man see from what he is created!) This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created. The intent of it is to guide man to accept (the reality of) the Hereafter, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he is also able to repeat it in the same way. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خُلِقَ مِن مَّآءٍ دَافِقٍ </div><p>(He is created from a water gushing forth.) meaning, the sexual fluid that comes out bursting forth from the man and the woman. Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ </div><p>(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) meaning, the backbone (or loins) of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest. Shabib bin Bishr reported from `Ikrimah who narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ </div><p>(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) \"The backbone of the man and the ribs of the woman.

This means that He is able to return this man that is created from fluid gushed forth. In other words, He is able to repeat his creation and resurrect him to the final abode. This is clearly possible, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he surely is able to repeat it. Indeed Allah has mentioned this proof in more than one place in the Qur'an.</p><h2>On the Day of Judgement, Man will have no Power or Assistance</h2><p>In this regard Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ </div><p>(The Day when all the secrets will be examined.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement the secrets will be tested. This means that they will be exposed and made manifest. Thus, the secret will be made open and that which is concealed will be well known.
