      "text": "<p>Special features of the Surah</p><p>There is consensus among the commentators that this Surah was revealed in Makkah. However, Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ and Qatadah ؓ contend that three of its verses are Madani and rest of the Surah is Makkan. Yet Qurtubi and a few others maintain that the Surah itself is Madani and only a few verses are Makkan.</p><p>The gist of the subject matter of the Surah is to describe and define the greatness of the Holy Qur'an and the truth of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، to which there were doubts expressed by the unbelievers. The Surah contains answers to their objections.</p><p>Commentary</p><p>تَبَارَ‌كَ (25:1) is derived from بَرَکَہ ، meaning abundance of a good thing. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ` e' ' has explained that the meaning of the first verse is that all blessings are from Allah alone. فُرْ‌قَانَ (Furgan, translated above as 'criterion' )is a title of the Qur'an and its meaning is to distinguish. The Holy Qur'an by its very nature distinguishes between right and wrong, and differentiates, through miracles between the right people and the wrong ones, hence it is called as Furqan.</p><p>لِلْعَالَمِينَ (warner to the worlds - 25:1). This proves that the Holy Prophet ﷺ prophethood was for the entire universe and not just for a certain community or time, as was the case with other prophets. In a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim, the Holy Prophet ﷺ has pointed out six special features about his prophethood. One of the special features is the universality of his prophethood i.e. it is for all ages and all people.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>In the forgoing verses a general answer was given to the doubts raised by the infidels and polytheists in regard to prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . Here in the above verses a detailed reply is given to the objections. The gist of the reply is that because of your ignorance and mental block you have raised the issue that if he were really a prophet, then he should have possessed a great deal of material wealth and gardens etc. so that he should have been free from making efforts for his sustenance. The simple reply to this objection is that there is no problem for Us to provide material wealth to Our messengers; rather if We so wish we can make them kings of the mammoth empires, as we had done in the case of Sayyidna Dawud (رح) and Sayyidna Sulayman\tعلیہ السلام who were made rulers of the gigantic empires and were endowed with enormous wealth, which is a clear sign of Our omnipotence. But in the interest of common people and other numerous considerations, it is required that prophets should be kept away from the material wealth of the world. Especially in the case of the Holy Prophet ﷺ it was preferred by Allah Ta’ ala to keep him in line with the ordinary Muslims by way of worldly possessions, and he also preferred for himself to be like that. It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad and in Tirmidhi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu 'Umamah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that Allah Ta’ ala offered to him to turn the entire valley and hills of Makkah into gold for him. On that he requested to Him \"No my Lord, I would prefer that I get sustenance one day (to offer my thanks to You) and go without food the next (to be patient). Also, Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ has reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said \"If I wanted, mountains of gold would have been around me.\" (Mazhari)</p><p>The sum and substance of all this is that it is Allah's wisdom to keep the prophets poor which is also in the best interest of the people at large. Also, the prophets are not forced to lead a poor life. On the contrary they have a choice either to opt for an ordinary simple life or else Allah Ta’ ala can make them wealthy with a lot of property. But Allah Ta ala has made them such that they do not desire any material wealth and instead prefer a simple and poor life for themselves.</p><p>The second objection infidels had raised was that if he was really a prophet, he would not have been eating and drinking like ordinary people nor would he walk in the markets to earn his livelihood. This objection was based on the assumption of many infidels that Allah's messengers could only be angels and not humans. The answer to this false notion is given in the Holy Qur'an at several places. The answer given here is that the prophets whom you admit to be prophets were also humans and not angels. They used to eat, drink and work like ordinary human beings. Hence you should have deduced from this that eating and drinking is not something repugnant to prophethood. The last verse وَمَا أَرْ‌سَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْ‌سَلِينَ إِلَّا إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ (And We did not send any messengers before you, but all of them used to eat food - 25:20) has put forward the same argument.</p><p>There is great wisdom in economic difference between people</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً (And We have made some of you test for some others - 25:20). There is an allusion in the verse that Allah Ta ala had complete power to make all humans wealthy, prosperous, healthy and of high status. But this way nobody would have been poor, weak or sick - a position which would have created innumerable social problems resulting in chaos and confusion. Therefore, Allah Taala has made some rich and some poor, some healthy and some sick, some strong and some weak, and some with high status and some others unknown. This way every single individual is at test because of his or her peculiar placing in society and community. The rich and healthy people are at test for their thankfulness, while poor and sick persons are on trial for their patience. For this very reason the Holy Prophet has advised that whenever you see someone who is wealthier, healthier, stronger or higher in status you should at once try to turn towards those who are lower than you in wealth, health, strength and status so that instead of feeling jealous, which is a sin, you should thank Allah Ta’ ala for giving you better placing in this world as against those who have less than you.

Sometimes it is also used for having fear, as mentioned by Ibn-al-Ambari, the famous scholar of Arabic lexicon. Here in this verse it is used for apprehension and fear. Thus the meaning of the phrase is 'those who are not apprehensive of being brought before Us'. The allusion is toward those who totally deny the Hereafter as only they could have the courage to raise such preposterous and absurd points and put such frivolous demands. Those who believe in the Hereafter dread it so much all the time that they have no time to waste over such ridiculous ideas. In the present time those who appear to be unsure about the teachings and injunctions of Islam and indulge in dubious debate and arguments under the influence of modern education allude toward weakness of their faith in the Hereafter. When one attains total faith in the Hereafter then there is no question of having such dubious doubts.</p>"

Here in this verse the objection as to why the Qur'an was revealed gradually bit by bit and not in one go is answered. The wisdom behind gradual revelation of the Qur'an as explained in the verse is that it was to keep the heart of the Holy Prophet ﷺ firm and strong. By gradual revelation the Holy Prophet's ﷺ heart was made strong in the following manner:</p><p>1.\tIt was made easy for him to remember the Qur'an by heart. If the whole Book was revealed in one go, its remembrance by heart would not have been that easy. Remembrance of the Qur'an by heart expelled all worries from his heart.</p><p>2.\tWhenever an objection was raised by the infidels or a maltreatment was perpetrated, a verse would reveal to give him fortitude. In case the entire Qur’ an was revealed in one piece and the fortitude for the special occasion had also been mentioned in it, its search in the Book would have been painstaking. Moreover, it would have been uncertain whether or not the attention of the Holy Prophet ﷺ would be drawn to the particular verse.</p><p>3. Instant response by way of revelation to answer awkward questions was by itself the confirmation of Allah Ta’ ala's support which is the biggest source of strength for the heart. The wisdom of keeping the heart strong is not dependent on gradual revelations alone.

      "text": "<p>To work during day time and rest at night is based on great Wisdom</p><p>And He is the One who has made the night an apparel for you, and the sleep a means of rest and has made the day a means of revival. [ 47]</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا وَالنَّوْمَ سُبَاتًا وَجَعَلَ النَّهَارَ‌ نُشُورً‌ا</p><p>The night is referred as the apparel in this verse to describe that it covers up everything like a natural sheet as does the dress to human body. The word سُبَاتًا (subata) is derived from سَبت (sabt) which means to cut out. سُبَات is that thing which cuts out some other thing.</p><p>Allah Ta’ ala has made the sleep to shed away the exhaustion and fatigue one develops after the daylong work. In sleep one is cut off with stress and strain of mind and body while they are rested. Hence the word سُبات is generally translated as rest, relaxation or tranquility. So the sense of the verse is that Allah Ta’ ala has created the night as a covering to everything then imposed sleep on men and all living things, so that they rest and relax.</p><p>Here one needs to ponder over a few things. Everyone knows that sleep is a blessing and a source of relaxation. But it is human nature to sleep in darkness. It is very difficult to sleep in day light, and even if one goes off to sleep, one is awakened quickly. Conforming to human needs and nature Allah Ta’ ala has made nights dark and cool, so that people can sleep and relax. Hence, night by itself is a blessing and sleep is another blessing. The third blessing is that the entire humanity and animals sleep at night instinctively. If the sleeping time of different people were different from one another, it would have created a number of problems. In such a situation some would have slept at one time and the others at some other, creating problems for one another, because when people are awake, they move about for various works and this movement; would have created noise to the annoyance and disturbance for those who were sleeping. Apart from this, people are dependent on each other in many ways and different times of their sleeping would have deprived them of helping each other in their works because working time of one would have been the time of rest for the other.</p><p>If human beings would have resorted to a social contract for uniting the times of rest and work for the whole world, it was not, at the first place, an easy task to make billions of people agree on a single resolution, then the implementation of such a contract would have required a lot of formal departments, and still there would have been room for violation of such a contract through corrupt means, as is observed in the contemporary forums. All such problems have been overcome by the creation of night and sleep by Allah Ta’ ala which are greatly beneficial and necessary for human and other living beings. Allah Ta’ ala has instilled in humans such an urge to sleep at night that one can keep awake only with great difficulty and effort. فَتَبَارَ‌كَ اللَّـهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِينَ</p><p>Similarly in وَجَعَلَ النَّهَارَ‌ نُشُورً‌ا (and has made the day a means of revival - 25:47), the day is described as revival, because its opposite, that is sleep, is like death when one loses all his senses. Here again, to keep awake and attend to one's needs during the day time is made mandatory in human beings. If this was not so, some people would have attended to their work while others slept, and this would have caused all sorts of problems.</p><p>As in the case of sleep, Allah Ta’ ala has bestowed a great blessing on human beings by creating its need at night. He has also made it part of human nature to keep awake and attend to work during day time, so that people should look after each other's needs. He has also fixed certain timings for certain desires and needs common in all human beings. For instance, all people feel hungry in the mornings and evenings and want to eat. So the eating times of all humans are common which is again a great blessing from Allah Ta’ ala</p>"

In Arabic طَهُور (Tahur) means something which is pure by itself and which also purifies other things. Allah Ta’ ala has given this quality to water that it is clean by itself and possesses the property to cleanse other things also. The water we use comes down from the clouds in the form of rain, hail or snow. Then some of it flows on the surface of the earth and the rest seeps down into the ground. Under the ground there is a natural drainage system which takes the underground water to every nook of the earth and then it reappears on the surface in the form of springs, fountains etc. Sometimes the underground water is drawn out by digging wells to reach it. All these waters i.e. that which falls in the form of rain, or that which flows on the surface of earth in the form of rivers, streams or canals, or that which is preserved underground are pure in Shari` ah and have inherent property of cleaning other things. There is consensus of opinion in ummah on this matter and it is the express purport of the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah.</p><p>When the water is in large quantity as in the case of a pond, pool or a canal, it remains pure even if something filthy has fallen in it. On this point also there is a general consensus, unless the effect of filth is perceptible and the colour, taste and smell of water changes. However, if the quantity of water is small and some filth drops in it, then there is a difference of opinion among the jurists (مُجتھدین) on the nature and quantity of filth as well as the quantity of water in which the filth falls. Details on this issue are described by Mazhari and Qurtubi in their commentaries and are also available in the books on Fiqh.</p>"

This verse has described that the rain is a source of irrigation for land, while it serves as a drink for 'many cattle and humans'. The point worth consideration here is why the word 'many' is used which indicates that some human beings do not benefit from it. This question may be answered by saying that the reference here is to the cattle and human beings living in jungles and deserts who directly use the water of rain.

One is enormous in size called oceans and cover up about two third of the global space while the rest of the one third space is made up of land mass on which people live. The water of the oceans and seas is extremely brackish, bitter and of a bad taste. On the other hand the water found on land in different forms is potable, pleasant and tasty. This water is just right for the needs of mankind and animals alike who drink it and use it for cleaning. If the water of the seas and oceans were not brackish, it would have decayed very quickly leaving behind a pungent and foul odor making the life unbearable for humans and animals on land. Moreover, the creatures living in ocean and sea water, and number manifold than those living on land could not have survived because when they die, they perish in the brackish water. If they were to die in sweet water their decomposition would have contaminated the water making the survival of the marine life impossible and its stink would have been unbearable for the life on land. Then the garbage of the land is generally dumped in the sea where it is decomposed (except for a few modern age items which need special treatment). Therefore, brackish water of the oceans and seas is a great blessing of Allah Ta’ ala for all creatures, whether living in the sea or on the land. Without the presence of brackish water mass, there would have been no marine or land life.</p><p>In this verse it is elucidated that it is a great blessing and grace of Allah Ta` a1a to have provided two types of waters in accordance with the needs of mankind. Then it is a perfect demonstration of His complete power that when a river of sweet water falls into the sea, the two waters .(the sweet and the brackish) do not mingle immediately where they meet, but for miles they remain separated from each other, despite the fact that there is no physical curtain between them. This is yet another example of His omnipotence.</p>"

So, he has spent only twenty years of his life in working.</p><p>After pointing out about the stars, the planets and the astronomical features, the Qur'an has made it clear that the repeated reference of these things in the Qur'an is for the purpose that people contemplate over their creation, movements and resulting phenomenon in order to help visualize and understand the One who creates and controls them, and then pay homage and thanks to Allah Ta’ ala.</p><p>Cosmological theories and the Qur’ an</p><p>As regards the questions as to what is the reality of the stellar formations and whether the stars are fixed in the sky or are floating in the space, no basic human need is dependent on answering these questions, neither in this world, nor in the Hereafter. Moreover, there are many issues of this type which could not be resolved finally, despite all the painstaking efforts undertaken by many researchers. Therefore, it is not a necessary service to the Qur'an to indulge in such controversies beyond the aforesaid purpose of the Holy Qur'an, that is, to ponder on these wonders as signs of the divine omnipotence and to pay homage to Him for their creation. The modern scientists have, no doubt, acquired wonderful achievements in inventing satellites and space-crafts, in travelling to the moon and bringing dust and stones from there, but it is a pity that the realistic approach about the Creator of this universe, suggested by the Holy Qur'an, was not only neglected by them, but being proud of these discoveries, they became more distant from it and the people became more confused about the Qur'anic expressions. There are some people who take these discoveries as against the Qur'anic expressions and therefore deny the facts proved by real observations, and there are others who try to twist the Qur'anic expressions to suit the modern theories. It is, therefore, deemed necessary to clarify the correct situation about these issues in some detail. We had already promised in our commentary to Surah Al-Hijr that we would discuss these issues in detail under Surah Al-Furqan. Now, here is that discussion:</p><p>Old and modern theories about the location of the planets and the Qur'anic expressions</p><p>Let us take the question about the location of the stars. The verse 61 above says, جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا (made the stellar formations in the sky). Here the words 'in the sky' apparently indicate that the planets are located in the sky. Similarly the words in a verse of Surah Nuh are as follows:</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ‌وْا كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّـهُ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا ﴿15﴾ وَجَعَلَ الْقَمَرَ‌ فِيهِنَّ نُورً‌ا وَجَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ سِرَ‌اجًا ﴿16﴾</p><p>Did you not realize how Allah has created seven skies, one over the other, and has made moon in them a light. (71:15, 16)</p><p>Here again the phrase فِيهِنَّ \"in them\" refers to skies which apparently indicates that moon is placed in the sky. But these expressions should not be taken as an absolute declaration that moon and other planets are located and fixed physically in the sky. The reason is that the Arabic word” سَمَاء ” (sama', translated as \"sky\" or 'heavens' ) is used for two different meanings. It is sometime used for the great mass of the sky, and sometimes for everything which is above us in the direction of the sky, including the atmosphere between earth and sky and the space. The Holy Qur’ an has used this word for both these meanings in different verses. When it speaks of the sky as a huge mass having gates guarded by angels which are opened at particular times, it takes the word for the first meaning. But when it describes the rain coming down from the sky, it takes the word 'sky' for the second sense. For example the Holy Qur’ an says,</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً طَهُورًا</p><p>And We have sent down purifying water from the heavens. (25:48)</p><p>Obviously the word (sama', translated as sky or heavens) in this verse is used in the second sense, firstly because the common observation (even in the days of the Holy Prophet ﷺ has proved that the rain comes from the clouds and not from the sky, and secondly because the Holy Qur'an itself has mentioned at different places in express terms that the rain comes from the clouds. For example, the following two verses are self-speaking on this point:</p><p>أَأَنتُمْ أَنزَلْتُمُوهُ مِنَ الْمُزْنِ أَمْ نَحْنُ الْمُنزِلُونَ</p><p>Aft Have you sent it (the rain) down from the clouds or are We who sends it down. (56:69)</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَ‌اتِ مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا</p><p>And We sent down abundant water from clouds full of rain. (78:14)</p><p>In the light of these verses, the word سَّمَاءِ (sky/heavens) used in verse 25:48 above is obviously used for the atmosphere above us.</p><p>Now, when the Qur'an has itself used the word 'sky' in both senses, the verses describing the stars and planets 'in the sky' have equal possibility of either of these two senses. They can be taken to mean that the planets are placed in the mass of the sky, and they can equally be taken to mean that they are in the space. In the presence of these two possibilities no absolute declaration about this issue can be attributed to the Holy Qur'an. Whatever situation about this issue is proved by observation or by research will not be against any express declaration of the Qur'an.</p><p>Realities of the universe and Qur'an</p><p>It is vital that we clear our thinking on the subject matter of the Holy Qur'an. It should be clearly understood that Qur'an is not a book of philosophy or astronomy. It does not deal with the subject of realities of the universe or the form, positioning and movements of its components e.g. stars, planets etc. But at the same time it does mention repeatedly about things on the earth and in the sky and in between them, and invites to ponder over them to set one's beliefs right. On going through all such verses one can make out clearly that the idea behind them is to set right the beliefs of the people or to help them draw benefits for their religious or mundane needs. For instance, Qur'an has repeatedly mentioned about the earth and sky the stars and planets and their movements and the effects of these movements for man to ponder over in order to comprehend and understand that this spectacular phenomenon has not come into being on its own but there is someone who has created all that, and that someone is Almighty Allah Ta’ ala. For the ordinary man it is not necessary to acquire knowledge of astronomy and related sciences but instead it is sufficient for him to observe the alternation of day and night, their shortening and lengthening of duration, the change in the tilt of sun bringing different seasons, the rising and waning of the moon, the eclipses of the moon and the sun, which every individual see happening. A common man sees them happening with perfect precision and knows that it is going on without the slightest alteration for centuries. Then he can draw the conclusion that there is some Power who has created it, and is running and holding it. That \"someone\" or that \"Power\" is none else but Allah Ta’ ala. To arrive at this conclusion one neither has to acquire any special philosophical knowledge or any research data nor the Qur’ an has asked to do so. All that Qur'an has asked in this regard is to pay attention to these phenomena which one can see by simple observation. Also the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions did not make any arrangement to study astronomical or cosmic theories or to collect data and information on the shape and form of celestial bodies. Had these verses on astronomical and cosmic realities been conveying the message to strive to find out such realities, then the Holy Prophet ﷺ would have definitely made an effort in this direction, especially in a situation when facilities were available in his time for acquiring such knowledge. People in Egypt, Syria, India and China had already worked on these subjects and had acquired some knowledge. Five hundred years before Christ (B.C) Pythagorean theory was propounded and established, and later in 139 A.D. Ptolemy also propounded his well known theory. rut the most revered person on whom these verses were revealed and the companions who learned them directly from him never made any attempt in that direction. Therefore it is abundantly clear that the Qur'anic verses inviting people to ponder over the cosmological signs did never intend that the space travel and the efforts to conquer the moon and other planets are the basic objectives of the Qur'an, as is suggested by some contemporary modernists under the influence of the West and its discoveries.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that the Holy Qur'an neither invites people's attention towards any old or new philosophical thesis or scientific research nor does it deal with them, nor does. it reject them. The plain and simple manner in which the Holy Qur'an deals with the subjects concerning universe and His creation is to confine their mention only to the extent they are related to the man's religious or worldly needs, and what man can comprehend and learn easily. On the other hand Qur'an does not involve itself in complicated philosophical discussions and researches which are beyond the comprehension of common man and which sometimes create more confusion in the minds of people for their ever changing nature because of the unending discoveries and inventions being made with the passage of time. In effect Qur'an guides the humanity toward its ultimate goal which is to seek and follow the righteous path to comply with the Will of Allah Ta’ ala in order to win over His grace in the everlasting abode in the Hereafter: It is neither required nor is it possible for everyone to indulge in the discussion of the realities of the universe for the theories of one period become obsolete in the next period by the new discoveries and inventions. Hence no theory or thesis could be regarded as final. The Holy Qur'an however does make allusions at certain places toward some realities covering subjects like astronomy, space, atmosphere, meteorology, oceanography, geology etc. but to the extent it is needed for human life here or in the Hereafter. Similarly, the Qur'an makes references about His creatures on earth related with botany, zoology, petrology and social sciences including trade, agriculture, industry etc., but again to the extent it is required to guide the man to fulfill his religious and worldly duties. Qur'an does not drag mankind toward unnecessary and futile discussions for making things complicated. However, it is only at some places in the Holy Qur'an that it mentions a particular issue of this nature expressly or gives a hint towards it.</p><p>Criteria of acceptance or rejection of scientific and philosophical theories in the commentary of the Holy Qur'an</p><p>The classical and modern religious scholars are unanimous on the point that if a statement is lucid and unambiguous in the Qur'an but it contradicts with any old or new theory, it is not permissible to try to twist the Qur'anic version to try to bring in it line with the modern theories. In such a situation the related theory would be regarded as based on some misconception. However, in the matters in which Qur'an does not give any express statement and where more than one interpretations are possible from the wordings of the Qur'an, then in that situation the interpretation closer to observations and evidence would be regarded as correct. For instance, we can take the case of this very verse جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُ‌وجًا (Stellar formations in the sky - 25:61) where it is not specified whether the stars are placed in the space or stuck in the sky. Now in the present time when it is proved by observations that stars are orbiting in the space and are not stuck in the sky, then the Pythagorean theory has been proved correct, because according to the express statements of the Qur'an and ahadith, sky has gates guarded by the angels and no one can enter into it. (Had the planets been fixed in the sky, the modern researchers would have not been able to reach them). Based on this observation the verses referring to the stars 'in the sky' will be construed to mean that these stars are in the space. And this will not be tantamount to twisting the Qur'anic statement, but only the adoption of one of the two possible interpretations. However, if it is claimed that the skies do not exist or that they can be pierced through by the rockets, then it will be in contradiction to Qur'anic wordings and cannot be accepted because Qur'an has clearly stated in several verses that sky is such an enclosure where there are gates guarded by the angles, and every one cannot enter there.</p><p>Similarly, the verse كُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ (Each floating in an orbit) ascertains the floating of stars in their orbits. Hence, Ptolemaic theory (propounded in 139 A.D) suggesting that the stars are embedded in the body of the sky and have no movement of their own, rather they move with the movement of the sky, is no more valid after the Qur'anic declaration that stars are orbiting.</p><p>Some earlier commentators who believed in the Ptolemaic theory which was in conflict with the Qur'anic version on astronomy had tried to stretch and twist the meanings of the Qur’ anic words to bring it in line with the Ptolemaic theory. Similarly, in present and recent times when some authors presume that some Qur'anic verses are at variance with some astronomical theories, they attempt to harmonize them with modern theories by twisting their meanings. Both these attitudes are incorrect and against the classical methodology of the righteous elders. It is, however, a fact that no theory from those advanced by astronomers is in contradiction to the Qur'an, except the theory of denial of the skies.</p><p>Sayyid Mahmud Alusi Baghdadi who is the greatest commentator and scholar of recent time because of his vast knowledge and understanding of not only the Qur'an and Sunnah but also of philosophy and astronomical sciences has condensed the work of all classical commentators in his famous and widely acclaimed commentary - Ruh ul-Ma` ani. He has adopted the same principle, which is described above. His grandson Allamah Sayyid Mahmud Shukri Alusi has written a book on the subject in which he has endorsed modern astronomical theories in the light of Qur'anic declarations without twisting their meanings. The relevant passage from his book is quoted below:</p><p>رأیت کثیرا من قواعدھا لا یعارض النّصوص الواردۃ فی الکتاب ولسنّۃ، علٰی انھا لو خالفت شیٔا من ذلک لم یلتفت الیھا ولم نؤول النصوص لاجلھا، والتاویل فیھا لیس من مذاھب السلف الحیّۃ بالقبول، بل لابدّ ان نقول ان المخالف لھا مشتمل من مذاھب السلف الحرّیۃ بالقبول ، بل لا بدّ ان نقول ان المخالف لھا مشتمل علٰی خلل فیہ، فان العقل الصریح لا یخالف النقل الصحیح، بل کل منھما یصدق الآخر و یؤیّدہ (مادل علیہ القرآن)</p><p>\"I have checked many principles of the modern astronomy. They are not in conflict with the Qur'anic text or Sunnah. But in case they differ with Qur'an and Sunnah then we shall discard them and would not twist the (meaning of) Qur'an and Sunnah because such twisting would be against the practice of the elders. In such situations we would argue that any theory which is in conflict with the Qur'an or Sunnah is imperfect, because the sound reason can never be against an authentic text (of Qur’ an or Sunnah) rather they are complimentary to each other.\"</p><p>In brief it can be said that the subject of stars and planets, their form and movements and related astronomical theories have been discussed and researched for a long time, even before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) in various countries like Egypt, Syria, India, China and Greece. Among them Pythagoras and Ptolemy are still well known.</p><p>Obviously, astronomy is not a new branch of knowledge. It has been the subject of human research since thousands of years. Egypt, Syria, India and China were the centres of astronomical research in the ancient ages. Pythagoras, the famous astronomer, used to teach astronomy in Italy five hundred years before Sayyidna Then, in 140 BC, Ptolemy ruled the field who developed a cosmological theory that was in total contradiction the theory of Pythagoras, but it found currency with the cooperation of the government, so much so that the theory of Pythagoras was pushed back to a situation where it was ignored almost totally. When the Greek sciences were translated into Arabic, it was the theory of Ptolemy that rules the field, and was rendered into Arabic and became popular in Arabic books. Many commentators of the Qur'an discussed the subject in the light of Ptolemaic theory.</p><p>It was in the fifteenth century A.D. (corresponding to the eleventh century A.H.) that the European scholars started their research on the subject. The pioneering work in the field was done by Copernicus, followed by Keiler of Germany and Galileo of Italy. All these astronomers falsified the theory of Ptolemy and endorsed the theory of Pythagoras. In eighteenth century A.D. the discoveries of Issac Newton further confirmed the theory of Pythagoras. He propounded the theory of gravity and proved through experiments that all the planets, including earth, have gravity which makes things fall onto them from above, but the range of gravity varies from planet to planet. If something is able to cross the range of gravity of the earth, it will never fall to the ground.</p><p>This theory was proved by empirical evidence when Russian and American scientists, who benefitted from some researches of Al-Bairuni, the well-known Muslim scientist, succeeded in sending rockets and satellites to the space which, after breaking the gravity range of the earth, started rotating around their orbit. This success prompted the scientists to travel to the planets through space, and ultimately some of them reached the moon, a fact which was admitted by all the experts and was not challenged, even by their opponents. It is from that time that the efforts to reach other planets and to undertake other missions to the space are going on upto the date.</p><p>It is interesting to note that John Glenn, the first American astronaut had written article after his successful return from the space in which he had admitted not only the existence of God, but also His omnipotence that controls the whole universe. He had also admitted that all our scientific accomplishments are almost worthless as compared to the natural process going on in the space which cannot be weighed by any type of measures. He had concluded the article with the admission that everything in this universe cannot be perceived or felt by human senses. There are many religious realities which are beyond the access of our senses, but we certainly know, through their visible effects, that they exist, and this leads us to believe that this universe is controlled by an omnipotent power. This article was published in those days in many periodicals, including Readers Digest.</p><p>This article shows that the end-result of all these effects was to admit that the mysteries of the universe are not still discovered and that all these planets are controlled by a Supreme, but incorporeal Power. And this is the reality that was declared by the prophets of Allah at the very first step, and this is the very conclusion for which the Holy Qur’ an has invited us to reflect on the creation of sky, earth, stars and planets etc.</p><p>Another point worth consideration is that these modern discoveries that cost trillions of dollars, despite their marvelous and admirable courage have not been able to solve the burning problems of humanity suffering from hunger, disease and unrest. The dust and stones brought from the moon at such a huge cost were of little benefit to those who face death on daily basis because of hunger or those who do not have clothes to wear or a home to live. The real benefit of such discoveries, that is, to believe in Allah and be grateful to Him, did not need such extra-ordinary efforts. These benefits can be drawn even by a rustic through simple observations of these objects, and this is exactly what the Holy Qur'an has stressed upon.</p><p>The gist of the matter is that the study of cosmology for making it a source of guidance towards Allah's omnipotence, His all-encompassing wisdom and His being the sole Creator and having no partner is the objective of the Qur'an towards which the Holy Book has invited us in many places. Secondly, study of these sciences to the extent that they are used for solving the real problems of life is also included in Qur'anic objectives, but with the difference that the worldly affairs are not taken to be the be-all and the end-all one's activities, but the worldly life is held to be a transitory stage to be looked after to the extent of real needs. The third objective for the study of cosmology which aims at solving merely theoretical issues having no nexus with the first two objectives is a futile exercise not encouraged by the Qur'an.</p><p>It is, therefore, clear that all the modern researches and discoveries cannot be held to be the exact objective of the Qur'an, as suggested by modern scholars. Similarly, these discoveries cannot be held to be repugnant to the Holy Qur'an, as observed by some conservative scholars. The fact is that these issues are not the subject matter of the Qur'an which is silent about them. If a reality is proved by experiments or observations, it cannot be taken as contradictory to the Qur'an, and that which is not yet proved no effort should be made to impose it on the Qur'an through fanciful interpretations.</p>"

Moreover, there are many issues of this type which could not be resolved finally, despite all the painstaking efforts undertaken by many researchers. Therefore, it is not a necessary service to the Qur'an to indulge in such controversies beyond the aforesaid purpose of the Holy Qur'an, that is, to ponder on these wonders as signs of the divine omnipotence and to pay homage to Him for their creation. The modern scientists have, no doubt, acquired wonderful achievements in inventing satellites and space-crafts, in travelling to the moon and bringing dust and stones from there, but it is a pity that the realistic approach about the Creator of this universe, suggested by the Holy Qur'an, was not only neglected by them, but being proud of these discoveries, they became more distant from it and the people became more confused about the Qur'anic expressions. There are some people who take these discoveries as against the Qur'anic expressions and therefore deny the facts proved by real observations, and there are others who try to twist the Qur'anic expressions to suit the modern theories. It is, therefore, deemed necessary to clarify the correct situation about these issues in some detail. We had already promised in our commentary to Surah Al-Hijr that we would discuss these issues in detail under Surah Al-Furqan. Now, here is that discussion:</p><p>Old and modern theories about the location of the planets and the Qur'anic expressions</p><p>Let us take the question about the location of the stars. The verse 61 above says, جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا (made the stellar formations in the sky). Here the words 'in the sky' apparently indicate that the planets are located in the sky. Similarly the words in a verse of Surah Nuh are as follows:</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ‌وْا كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّـهُ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا ﴿15﴾ وَجَعَلَ الْقَمَرَ‌ فِيهِنَّ نُورً‌ا وَجَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ سِرَ‌اجًا ﴿16﴾</p><p>Did you not realize how Allah has created seven skies, one over the other, and has made moon in them a light. (71:15, 16)</p><p>Here again the phrase فِيهِنَّ \"in them\" refers to skies which apparently indicates that moon is placed in the sky. But these expressions should not be taken as an absolute declaration that moon and other planets are located and fixed physically in the sky. The reason is that the Arabic word” سَمَاء ” (sama', translated as \"sky\" or 'heavens' ) is used for two different meanings. It is sometime used for the great mass of the sky, and sometimes for everything which is above us in the direction of the sky, including the atmosphere between earth and sky and the space. The Holy Qur’ an has used this word for both these meanings in different verses. When it speaks of the sky as a huge mass having gates guarded by angels which are opened at particular times, it takes the word for the first meaning. But when it describes the rain coming down from the sky, it takes the word 'sky' for the second sense. For example the Holy Qur’ an says,</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً طَهُورًا</p><p>And We have sent down purifying water from the heavens. (25:48)</p><p>Obviously the word (sama', translated as sky or heavens) in this verse is used in the second sense, firstly because the common observation (even in the days of the Holy Prophet ﷺ has proved that the rain comes from the clouds and not from the sky, and secondly because the Holy Qur'an itself has mentioned at different places in express terms that the rain comes from the clouds. For example, the following two verses are self-speaking on this point:</p><p>أَأَنتُمْ أَنزَلْتُمُوهُ مِنَ الْمُزْنِ أَمْ نَحْنُ الْمُنزِلُونَ</p><p>Aft Have you sent it (the rain) down from the clouds or are We who sends it down. (56:69)</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَ‌اتِ مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا</p><p>And We sent down abundant water from clouds full of rain. (78:14)</p><p>In the light of these verses, the word سَّمَاءِ (sky/heavens) used in verse 25:48 above is obviously used for the atmosphere above us.</p><p>Now, when the Qur'an has itself used the word 'sky' in both senses, the verses describing the stars and planets 'in the sky' have equal possibility of either of these two senses. They can be taken to mean that the planets are placed in the mass of the sky, and they can equally be taken to mean that they are in the space. In the presence of these two possibilities no absolute declaration about this issue can be attributed to the Holy Qur'an. Whatever situation about this issue is proved by observation or by research will not be against any express declaration of the Qur'an.</p><p>Realities of the universe and Qur'an</p><p>It is vital that we clear our thinking on the subject matter of the Holy Qur'an. It should be clearly understood that Qur'an is not a book of philosophy or astronomy. It does not deal with the subject of realities of the universe or the form, positioning and movements of its components e.g. stars, planets etc. But at the same time it does mention repeatedly about things on the earth and in the sky and in between them, and invites to ponder over them to set one's beliefs right. On going through all such verses one can make out clearly that the idea behind them is to set right the beliefs of the people or to help them draw benefits for their religious or mundane needs. For instance, Qur'an has repeatedly mentioned about the earth and sky the stars and planets and their movements and the effects of these movements for man to ponder over in order to comprehend and understand that this spectacular phenomenon has not come into being on its own but there is someone who has created all that, and that someone is Almighty Allah Ta’ ala. For the ordinary man it is not necessary to acquire knowledge of astronomy and related sciences but instead it is sufficient for him to observe the alternation of day and night, their shortening and lengthening of duration, the change in the tilt of sun bringing different seasons, the rising and waning of the moon, the eclipses of the moon and the sun, which every individual see happening. A common man sees them happening with perfect precision and knows that it is going on without the slightest alteration for centuries. Then he can draw the conclusion that there is some Power who has created it, and is running and holding it. That \"someone\" or that \"Power\" is none else but Allah Ta’ ala. To arrive at this conclusion one neither has to acquire any special philosophical knowledge or any research data nor the Qur’ an has asked to do so. All that Qur'an has asked in this regard is to pay attention to these phenomena which one can see by simple observation. Also the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions did not make any arrangement to study astronomical or cosmic theories or to collect data and information on the shape and form of celestial bodies. Had these verses on astronomical and cosmic realities been conveying the message to strive to find out such realities, then the Holy Prophet ﷺ would have definitely made an effort in this direction, especially in a situation when facilities were available in his time for acquiring such knowledge. People in Egypt, Syria, India and China had already worked on these subjects and had acquired some knowledge. Five hundred years before Christ (B.C) Pythagorean theory was propounded and established, and later in 139 A.D. Ptolemy also propounded his well known theory. rut the most revered person on whom these verses were revealed and the companions who learned them directly from him never made any attempt in that direction. Therefore it is abundantly clear that the Qur'anic verses inviting people to ponder over the cosmological signs did never intend that the space travel and the efforts to conquer the moon and other planets are the basic objectives of the Qur'an, as is suggested by some contemporary modernists under the influence of the West and its discoveries.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that the Holy Qur'an neither invites people's attention towards any old or new philosophical thesis or scientific research nor does it deal with them, nor does. it reject them. The plain and simple manner in which the Holy Qur'an deals with the subjects concerning universe and His creation is to confine their mention only to the extent they are related to the man's religious or worldly needs, and what man can comprehend and learn easily. On the other hand Qur'an does not involve itself in complicated philosophical discussions and researches which are beyond the comprehension of common man and which sometimes create more confusion in the minds of people for their ever changing nature because of the unending discoveries and inventions being made with the passage of time. In effect Qur'an guides the humanity toward its ultimate goal which is to seek and follow the righteous path to comply with the Will of Allah Ta’ ala in order to win over His grace in the everlasting abode in the Hereafter: It is neither required nor is it possible for everyone to indulge in the discussion of the realities of the universe for the theories of one period become obsolete in the next period by the new discoveries and inventions. Hence no theory or thesis could be regarded as final. The Holy Qur'an however does make allusions at certain places toward some realities covering subjects like astronomy, space, atmosphere, meteorology, oceanography, geology etc. but to the extent it is needed for human life here or in the Hereafter. Similarly, the Qur'an makes references about His creatures on earth related with botany, zoology, petrology and social sciences including trade, agriculture, industry etc., but again to the extent it is required to guide the man to fulfill his religious and worldly duties. Qur'an does not drag mankind toward unnecessary and futile discussions for making things complicated. However, it is only at some places in the Holy Qur'an that it mentions a particular issue of this nature expressly or gives a hint towards it.</p><p>Criteria of acceptance or rejection of scientific and philosophical theories in the commentary of the Holy Qur'an</p><p>The classical and modern religious scholars are unanimous on the point that if a statement is lucid and unambiguous in the Qur'an but it contradicts with any old or new theory, it is not permissible to try to twist the Qur'anic version to try to bring in it line with the modern theories. In such a situation the related theory would be regarded as based on some misconception. However, in the matters in which Qur'an does not give any express statement and where more than one interpretations are possible from the wordings of the Qur'an, then in that situation the interpretation closer to observations and evidence would be regarded as correct. For instance, we can take the case of this very verse جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُ‌وجًا (Stellar formations in the sky - 25:61) where it is not specified whether the stars are placed in the space or stuck in the sky. Now in the present time when it is proved by observations that stars are orbiting in the space and are not stuck in the sky, then the Pythagorean theory has been proved correct, because according to the express statements of the Qur'an and ahadith, sky has gates guarded by the angels and no one can enter into it. (Had the planets been fixed in the sky, the modern researchers would have not been able to reach them). Based on this observation the verses referring to the stars 'in the sky' will be construed to mean that these stars are in the space. And this will not be tantamount to twisting the Qur'anic statement, but only the adoption of one of the two possible interpretations. However, if it is claimed that the skies do not exist or that they can be pierced through by the rockets, then it will be in contradiction to Qur'anic wordings and cannot be accepted because Qur'an has clearly stated in several verses that sky is such an enclosure where there are gates guarded by the angles, and every one cannot enter there.</p><p>Similarly, the verse كُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ (Each floating in an orbit) ascertains the floating of stars in their orbits. Hence, Ptolemaic theory (propounded in 139 A.D) suggesting that the stars are embedded in the body of the sky and have no movement of their own, rather they move with the movement of the sky, is no more valid after the Qur'anic declaration that stars are orbiting.</p><p>Some earlier commentators who believed in the Ptolemaic theory which was in conflict with the Qur'anic version on astronomy had tried to stretch and twist the meanings of the Qur’ anic words to bring it in line with the Ptolemaic theory. Similarly, in present and recent times when some authors presume that some Qur'anic verses are at variance with some astronomical theories, they attempt to harmonize them with modern theories by twisting their meanings. Both these attitudes are incorrect and against the classical methodology of the righteous elders. It is, however, a fact that no theory from those advanced by astronomers is in contradiction to the Qur'an, except the theory of denial of the skies.</p><p>Sayyid Mahmud Alusi Baghdadi who is the greatest commentator and scholar of recent time because of his vast knowledge and understanding of not only the Qur'an and Sunnah but also of philosophy and astronomical sciences has condensed the work of all classical commentators in his famous and widely acclaimed commentary - Ruh ul-Ma` ani. He has adopted the same principle, which is described above. His grandson Allamah Sayyid Mahmud Shukri Alusi has written a book on the subject in which he has endorsed modern astronomical theories in the light of Qur'anic declarations without twisting their meanings. The relevant passage from his book is quoted below:</p><p>رأیت کثیرا من قواعدھا لا یعارض النّصوص الواردۃ فی الکتاب ولسنّۃ، علٰی انھا لو خالفت شیٔا من ذلک لم یلتفت الیھا ولم نؤول النصوص لاجلھا، والتاویل فیھا لیس من مذاھب السلف الحیّۃ بالقبول، بل لابدّ ان نقول ان المخالف لھا مشتمل من مذاھب السلف الحرّیۃ بالقبول ، بل لا بدّ ان نقول ان المخالف لھا مشتمل علٰی خلل فیہ، فان العقل الصریح لا یخالف النقل الصحیح، بل کل منھما یصدق الآخر و یؤیّدہ (مادل علیہ القرآن)</p><p>\"I have checked many principles of the modern astronomy. They are not in conflict with the Qur'anic text or Sunnah. But in case they differ with Qur'an and Sunnah then we shall discard them and would not twist the (meaning of) Qur'an and Sunnah because such twisting would be against the practice of the elders. In such situations we would argue that any theory which is in conflict with the Qur'an or Sunnah is imperfect, because the sound reason can never be against an authentic text (of Qur’ an or Sunnah) rather they are complimentary to each other.\"</p><p>In brief it can be said that the subject of stars and planets, their form and movements and related astronomical theories have been discussed and researched for a long time, even before the birth of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) in various countries like Egypt, Syria, India, China and Greece. Among them Pythagoras and Ptolemy are still well known.</p><p>Obviously, astronomy is not a new branch of knowledge. It has been the subject of human research since thousands of years. Egypt, Syria, India and China were the centres of astronomical research in the ancient ages. Pythagoras, the famous astronomer, used to teach astronomy in Italy five hundred years before Sayyidna Then, in 140 BC, Ptolemy ruled the field who developed a cosmological theory that was in total contradiction the theory of Pythagoras, but it found currency with the cooperation of the government, so much so that the theory of Pythagoras was pushed back to a situation where it was ignored almost totally. When the Greek sciences were translated into Arabic, it was the theory of Ptolemy that rules the field, and was rendered into Arabic and became popular in Arabic books. Many commentators of the Qur'an discussed the subject in the light of Ptolemaic theory.</p><p>It was in the fifteenth century A.D. (corresponding to the eleventh century A.H.) that the European scholars started their research on the subject. The pioneering work in the field was done by Copernicus, followed by Keiler of Germany and Galileo of Italy. All these astronomers falsified the theory of Ptolemy and endorsed the theory of Pythagoras. In eighteenth century A.D. the discoveries of Issac Newton further confirmed the theory of Pythagoras. He propounded the theory of gravity and proved through experiments that all the planets, including earth, have gravity which makes things fall onto them from above, but the range of gravity varies from planet to planet. If something is able to cross the range of gravity of the earth, it will never fall to the ground.</p><p>This theory was proved by empirical evidence when Russian and American scientists, who benefitted from some researches of Al-Bairuni, the well-known Muslim scientist, succeeded in sending rockets and satellites to the space which, after breaking the gravity range of the earth, started rotating around their orbit. This success prompted the scientists to travel to the planets through space, and ultimately some of them reached the moon, a fact which was admitted by all the experts and was not challenged, even by their opponents. It is from that time that the efforts to reach other planets and to undertake other missions to the space are going on upto the date.</p><p>It is interesting to note that John Glenn, the first American astronaut had written article after his successful return from the space in which he had admitted not only the existence of God, but also His omnipotence that controls the whole universe. He had also admitted that all our scientific accomplishments are almost worthless as compared to the natural process going on in the space which cannot be weighed by any type of measures. He had concluded the article with the admission that everything in this universe cannot be perceived or felt by human senses. There are many religious realities which are beyond the access of our senses, but we certainly know, through their visible effects, that they exist, and this leads us to believe that this universe is controlled by an omnipotent power. This article was published in those days in many periodicals, including Readers Digest.</p><p>This article shows that the end-result of all these effects was to admit that the mysteries of the universe are not still discovered and that all these planets are controlled by a Supreme, but incorporeal Power. And this is the reality that was declared by the prophets of Allah at the very first step, and this is the very conclusion for which the Holy Qur’ an has invited us to reflect on the creation of sky, earth, stars and planets etc.</p><p>Another point worth consideration is that these modern discoveries that cost trillions of dollars, despite their marvelous and admirable courage have not been able to solve the burning problems of humanity suffering from hunger, disease and unrest. The dust and stones brought from the moon at such a huge cost were of little benefit to those who face death on daily basis because of hunger or those who do not have clothes to wear or a home to live. The real benefit of such discoveries, that is, to believe in Allah and be grateful to Him, did not need such extra-ordinary efforts. These benefits can be drawn even by a rustic through simple observations of these objects, and this is exactly what the Holy Qur'an has stressed upon.</p><p>The gist of the matter is that the study of cosmology for making it a source of guidance towards Allah's omnipotence, His all-encompassing wisdom and His being the sole Creator and having no partner is the objective of the Qur'an towards which the Holy Book has invited us in many places. Secondly, study of these sciences to the extent that they are used for solving the real problems of life is also included in Qur'anic objectives, but with the difference that the worldly affairs are not taken to be the be-all and the end-all one's activities, but the worldly life is held to be a transitory stage to be looked after to the extent of real needs. The third objective for the study of cosmology which aims at solving merely theoretical issues having no nexus with the first two objectives is a futile exercise not encouraged by the Qur'an.</p><p>It is, therefore, clear that all the modern researches and discoveries cannot be held to be the exact objective of the Qur'an, as suggested by modern scholars. Similarly, these discoveries cannot be held to be repugnant to the Holy Qur'an, as observed by some conservative scholars. The fact is that these issues are not the subject matter of the Qur'an which is silent about them. If a reality is proved by experiments or observations, it cannot be taken as contradictory to the Qur'an, and that which is not yet proved no effort should be made to impose it on the Qur'an through fanciful interpretations.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>Upto this point Surah Al-Furqan has mostly discussed the proofs of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and answered various objections raised in this regard by disbelievers and pagans. While dealing with this subject Allah's wrath and punishment on those who deny His injunctions was also mentioned. Now, at the end of the Surah it refers to those special servants of His who firmly believe in the Holy Prophet's prophethood and their beliefs, deeds and dealings are all in conformity with the will of Allah and His messenger and who follow the Shari` ah.</p><p>The Holy Qur’ an has awarded the title of ` Ibad-ur-Rabman to such special servants of Allah Ta’ ala, which is indeed the highest honour. Although all creatures are governed by His will compulsorily, but here the voluntary worship by free will is alluded. That is to surrender completely before Allah and to make all deeds and desires conforming to His pleasure with one's own choice. In these last verses of the Surah the special servants of Allah are described whom He has Himself called as His servants to grant them unique honour. Their traits and characteristics are mentioned in the last verses until the end of the Surah. In between this description repentance from infidelity and sins and its effects are also referred to.</p><p>By calling these pious persons as His own slaves, Allah Ta'ala has given to them a great title of honour. But by selecting the name Rahman (the All-Merciful) for Himself, out of all His Beautiful Names and attributes, the hint is perhaps given to the fact that these pious people, being the slaves of the All-Merciful, should reflect and demonstrate the quality of mercifulness through their general behavior.</p><p>Special traits of Allah Ta’ ala's favoured servants</p><p>In the verses under review thirteen traits and habits of the special and favoured servants of Allah Ta’ ala are mentioned. Included among them are correct beliefs, righteous acts, both physical and financial, to obey the command of Allah and His messenger, social dealings with other persons, Allah's fear in His worship, refraining from all sorts of sins and carrying along wife and children on the righteous path with oneself.</p><p>The first characteristic of such people is that they are \"slaves\" (عَبَاد) which is the plural of the word عَبد (slave). Here it means the slave who is the property of his Master. All his deeds and prerogatives together with his very life are dedicated to follow the command and will of the Master.</p><p>Only such a person can claim to be Allah's slave whose views and beliefs, thinking and desires, and deeds and actions are totally in line with the command and pleasure of his Rab (Master) and who keeps himself alert to carry out each and every command as soon as he is required to.</p><p>The second characteristic</p><p>يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ هَوْنًا (25:63) that is \"they walk on the earth humbly\". Here the word ھَون (haven) is used in the sense of humbleness, modesty and decorum - that is one does not walk with pride or arrogance. It does not mean that one should walk very slowly, because it is against Sunnah if it is without any need. According to the description given in the books of his biography, the Holy Prophet ﷺ used not to walk slowly. Instead his walk was on quicker side. It is recorded in a Hadith کانّما الارض تطوی لہ that is \"He</p><p>used to walk in a manner as if ground was shrinking for him\". (Ibn Kathir) It is for this reason that the righteous elders have described the slow walk, like that of a sick person, as a symbol of arrogance, a sham habit, and something unwanted (مکروہ). Sayyidna ` Umar once saw a young man walking very slowly. He ؓ asked him\" Are you sick\". He replied \"No\". Then Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ raised his stick on him and commanded \"Always walk robustly\". (Ibn Kathir)</p><p>Hasan Al-Basri (رح) has said while explaining this verse عَلَى الْأَرْ‌ضِ هَوْنًا (25:63) that the organs of sincere believers are always humble before Allah, so much so that the one who is not familiar with them feels that they are sick or disabled, while they are fit and healthy. As a matter of fact it is the awe of God which has overtaken them and which has not struck the others. It is the fright of Hereafter which has refrained them from unnecessary mundane practices. Those who do not have faith in God and keep themselves engrossed in worldly affairs suffer only with disappointment (because they do not get the desired result in this world, and lose their share in the Hereafter as well). And those who regard sustenance as the only reward from Allah Ta’ ala and neglect practising morality have indeed very little understanding and for them there is great punishment. (Ibn Kathir)</p><p>The third characteristic</p><p>وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الْجَاهِلُونَ قَالُوا سَلَامًا (And when the ignorant people speak to them, they reply peacefully - 25:63): It should be kept in mind that the word \"ignorant\" in this verse refers to a person who acts like an ignorant person, notwithstanding that he might be a knowledgeable person. Also, the word سلام (peace) is not used here in its customary sense of greeting, but for any word causing peace. What is meant here is that in response to ignorance they keep composed and answer with calmness so that others are not offended and they do not commit a sin. The same explanation is put forward by Sayyidna Mujahid and Muqatil رحمۃ اللہ علیہما etc. The intended meaning is that they do not avenge from those who talk to them like ignorant people.</p>"

Special mention of night worship is made here firstly, because this time being a time of rest, requires extra effort, and secondly because it rules out the possibility of showing one's worship to others. The idea is to express that they spend their day and night in submission before Allah during the day by teaching and spreading religious tenets and struggling in the way of Allah and at night by praying before Him. The sayings of the Holy Prophet ﷺ have extolled the night prayers (تَھَجّد). Tirmidhi has reported on the authority of Sayyidna Abu 'Umamah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Remain steadfast to your night prayers as this has been the practice of all righteous people before your time, and this will bring you closer to Allah Ta’ ala and will expiate the evils and keep you away from sins\".

That is Allah's blessed servants are neither spendthrifts nor misers but they spend moderately. The words اسراف (israf, i.e. extravagance) and إقتَار (iqtar, i.e. miserliness) are used in the verse for the two opposite traits. Israf means to cross the limits. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Juraij رحمۃ اللہ علیہم any spending on something sinful, however little it may be, is israf, while others say that even overspending in the rightful and allowed things which is wasteful would fall under the definition of israf. It is because any wasteful spending is by itself a sin and hence israf. Allah Ta’ ala has said إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِ‌ينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ (Surely squanderers are brothers of Shaitan - 17:27). In this way the latter explanation is also covered in the explanation given by Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that is any spending on some sinful thing is\tاِسرَاف . (Mazhari)</p><p>اِقتَار (iqtar) means to spend with miserliness. In Islamic jurisprudence it means to be tight fisted where a believer is directed to spend. In case one does not spend at all at a place where he has been directed to spend, then that is the worst situation. This explanation is also given by Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، Qatadah etc. (Mazhari) Therefore, the message of the verse is that Allah's blessed servants are neither spendthrifts nor misers but in the matter of spending they take the middle path.</p><p>There is a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ :</p><p>مِن فِقہِ الرَّجُلِ قَصدُہ ، فِی مَعِیشَتِہٖ</p><p>That is \"It is the sagacity of man to adopt the middle path in spending\" In another Saying quoted by</p><p>Sayyidna Abdullah Ibn Masud the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p>مَا عال من اقتصد</p><p>That is \"The person who sticks to the middle path and moderation in spending will never become a destitute and poor\".

The first six characteristics included the principles of obedience and now the characteristics of disobedience are described.

This is the description of the major and grave sins pertaining to one's deeds. It is mentioned that Allah's blessed servants do not go even near them; neither they indulge in adultery nor do they kill innocent people. After describing the beliefs and big sins of one's deeds the verse says وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَامًا (25:68) that is, whoever will involve himself in the above mentioned sins will get punished accordingly. Abu Ubaidah has described the meaning of the word اَثَام (atham) in this verse as punishment of sin. But some other commentators have said that اَثَام is the name of a valley in the Hell which is full of severe and rigorous punishments, and they have quoted a few sayings in support of this contention.

On the face of it, it looks repetition of the same subject as described in the preceding verse i.e. تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا . But Qurtubi while quoting Qaffal has explained that this repentance is different and separate from the repentance described in the previous verse. It is because the previous verse related to deniers of monotheism and infidels who indulged in adultery and homicide and then submitted to Islam. Hence their sins were converted into virtues. But here the second verse speaks about the repentance of the Muslim sinners. This may be explained by the fact that in the previous verse the repentance was combined with the word آمَنَ which means that they accepted Islam whereas in the second verse the word آمَنَ is not there, which means that in the second verse the repentance is related to those sinners who had already converted to Islam or that they were Muslims, but by negligence indulged in adultery and homicide. Hence this verse relates to those Muslims who commit sins, but then repent on their folly sincerely and seek Allah's forgiveness and then keep themselves away from sins and evil deeds. Such repentance by the Muslims will be regarded in order and accepted. It should be understood here that the word تَوبَہ (taubah) is used here in conditional clause as well as in principal clause. In the conditional clause it means verbal repentance, and in the principal clause it refers to the practical repentance in the sense of correcting one's deeds. Hence it means that if someone repented on his sins and proved his sincerity by not indulging in those sins again would be regarded as on the right path towards Allah Ta’ ala. As against this the one who repented on his past sins but continued indulging in those sins, is like the one who has not repented.</p><p>In brief if a Muslim indulged in a sin by negligence and then realized that he has done wrong and repented and after that kept himself away from the sin, his repentance will be accepted by Allah Ta’ ala, and hopefully he will get the same benefit as described in the first verse i.e. his sins will be converted into virtues.</p><p>Some rules of taubah (repentance) from sins had been mentioned during the traits of Allah's favoured servants.

      "text": "<p>The tenth characteristic</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ‌ (And those who do not witness falsehood - 25:72). That is they do not participate in the meetings where lie and falsehood has currency. The biggest falsehood is the kufr (disbelief) and shirk, and the next in order comes the common lie and acts of sin. In other words the blessed and favoured servants of Allah avoid attending such meetings. Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that these meetings or assemblies refer to infidels festivals, carnivals and field days; while Sayyidna Mujahid and Muhammad Ibn Hanifah رحمۃ اللہ علیہما are of the view that they relate to music concerts. According to ` Amr Ibn Qais they refer to vulgar and cheap dance parties Zuhri and Imam Malik (رح) term them as liquor drinking parties (Ibn Kathir). In any case there is no contradiction in all these explanations because all such gatherings come under the definition of assembly of falsehood. The righteous people should avoid such gathering, as even 'an intentional look at them is tantamount’ to participation in them. (Mazhari)</p><p>Some commentators have taken the sentence يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ‌\tto mean that they do not give false evidence, which is one of the possible meaning of the word َشْهَدُونَ (The English translation of the sentence given in the text as \"do not witness falsehood\" has a slight indication to this interpretation also). It is a well known fact that both Holy Qur'an and Sunnah declare the false evidence as a great sin and an enormous evil. Bukhari and Muslim have recorded Sayyidna ` Abbas ؓ quoting that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that false evidence is the gravest of the major sins.</p><p>Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ said that if the offence of giving false evidence is proved against someone, he should be flogged with forty stripes, and then his face be painted black and taken round the market place, and after that put in jail for a long time. (Mazhari)</p><p>The Eleventh Characteristic</p><p>وَإِذَا مَرُّ‌وا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّ‌وا كِرَ‌امًا (and when they pass by the absurd things, Pass by with dignity - 72). That is if by chance they happen to pass by immoral gatherings, they walk away with dignity and grace. In other words as they do not attend such gatherings intentionally, if they happen to pass by them sometimes by chance they just walk away from there in a dignified manner. That is despite their belief that their evil acts are hateful, they do not take pride or regard themselves superior for not indulging in them. Once Sayyidna Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ happened to pass by an absurd and dissolute gathering, so he did not stop there but simply walked away. When the Holy Prophet\tﷺ learnt about this incidence he remarked \"Ibn Masud has become کریم (dignified) \" and then recited this verse wherein it is enjoined to walk away from dissolute gatherings with dignity.

They do not behave like the ignorant or negligent persons as if they have not seen or listened i.e. not understood the message. Two things are mentioned in this verse. One, to fall at Divine revelation i.e. to listen them with full attention. This is a virtuous and commendable act. Second, to fall at the verses like deaf and dumb people which means to listen to the message but without any purpose or commitment and act in a manner that the real message has not been registered, and even if they follow the Qur'anic message it is not in line with the practices of the companions of the Prophet or their followers. Such people follow their own whims based on hearsay, which is as bad as not following the Divine message.</p><p>Self-study of religious precepts is not enough but they need to be acted upon in the light of interpretation given by classic scholars</p><p>As it is condemned in the verses under study that Divine message is ignored. It is also pointed out with equal emphasis that it is listened and acted upon without due diligence, that is without comprehending the intent and spirit of the precept and according to one's own sweet will. Ibn Kathir has reported on the authority of Ibn ` Aun that he inquired from Hadrat Sha'bi رحمۃ اللہ علیہ\tthat if he comes across a people who are in the state of sajdah (prostration), whether it is correct for him to join them in sajdah. Sha'bi (رح) replied in the negative explaining that it would not be correct for him to join in their prostration unless he finds out the purpose of that act. It is not proper for a believer to join in any action without knowing the purport of that act, rather he should seek to know the purpose behind an act before taking it up for himself. When one has not listened the verse of prostration, nor does he know the reason for their prostration it is not allowed for him to go in prostration.</p><p>It is a matter of great satisfaction that there is a new tendency among the younger generation and modern educated people to study the Qur’ an but to achieve this purpose they often deem it enough to study the Qur’ an and try to understand it through the translations of the Qur'an on their own. This practice being against the correct principles of learning something, often makes them fall into misconceptions. It is a well-settled fact that education and knowledge cannot be imparted only through books unless guidance of a teacher is available for explaining the intricacies of the subject which normally go unnoticed by an ordinary reader. It is rather strange why people feel that this basic rule does not apply to Qur'an and its related subjects and try to indulge in interpreting the Holy Book according to their own wishes. This type of study and interpreting Qur'an on one's own without the help and guidance of a well qualified teacher also falls under the purview of this verse i.e. \"they do not throw themselves upon as if they were blind and dumb\". May Allah lead us to the right path.</p>"

(25:74)</p><p>This verse contains a prayer for one's spouses and children. According to the explanation put forward by Hasan al-Basri (رح) one can draw solace from his dear ones (wife and children) if they submit to the way of Allah. That is the true bliss for a man, and if the good health and well being of the wife and children is also added to this, it is also in order.</p><p>What is alluded here is that the righteous servants of God do not care about correcting themselves only, but also take care of the virtuous actions of their children and spouse, and keep trying for their improvement, and it is a part of their efforts that they pray Allah to make them take the right path. The second sentence of this verse says وَاجْعَلْنَا لِلْمُتَّقِينَ إِمَامًا (and make us heads of the God-fearing - 25:74) Apparently this is a prayer for getting a high status and a source of pride, which is forbidden by other injunctions of the Holy Qur'an. The Qur’ an says at another place\" تِلْكَ الدَّارُ‌ الْآخِرَ‌ةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُرِ‌يدُونَ عُلُوًّا فِي الْأَرْ‌ضِ وَلَا فَسَادًا that is \"As for that ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it to those who intend neither haughtiness on earth nor mischief (28:83). And the (best) end is for the God-fearing - 28:83\". Hence, some scholars have commented about this sentence of the verse that everyone is the head or Imam of his family. Thus, if his family members become God fearing, he will automatically be their head or Imam. Therefore, the final outcome is that prayer was not meant for personal aggrandizement, but for the family members to follow the right path. Ibrahim Nakha` i (رح) has also explained about this verse that the prayer contained in it is not meant for a high position or authority for oneself but to request the grant of such a disposition that people try to emulate it in religious deeds and actions, and that it be of benefit to others and thus might fetch the praying people some of its reward. And Sayyidna Makhul Shami (رح) has elucidated that the purpose of the prayer is to implore an exalted status of God consciousness that even the God fearing people may also draw inspiration to follow that. Qurtubi has narrated both these explanations and then commented that the net outcome of both is the same, that the desire for an elated position or high office in religious affairs for attaining reward in the Hereafter is not improper; rather it is allowed. On the other hand in verse لَا يُرِ‌يدُونَ عُلُوًّا (who intend neither haughtiness - 28:83) the desire and search for worldly exaltation and authority has been condemned. Here the description about the main traits of ` Ibad-ur-Rahman or the perfect believers has been completed. Now their rewards and degrees of exaltation in the Hereafter are related.</p>"
