      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَ‌تْ (When the sun will be folded up...81:1) The word kawwara is derived from Takwir which denotes for the sun 'to lose its light'.1 Sayyidna Hasan Basri (رح) has attached this interpretation to it. Another sense of the word is 'to cause to fall'. Rabi` Ibn Khaitham assigns the following interpretation to this verse: The Sun will be thrown into the ocean, and as a result of its heat the entire ocean will turn into fire. The two interpretations are not contradictory. They may be reconciled thus: first, its light will be put off and then it may be thrown into the ocean. Sahih of Bukhari records from Sayyidna Abu Huharirah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that on the Day of Resurrection the Sun and the Moon would be thrown into the ocean. Musnad of Bazzar has the addition that they will be thrown into Hell. Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Abid-Dunya and Abush-Shaikh stated that on the Day of Resurrection Allah will throw the Sun, the Moon and all stars into the ocean. Then a violent wind will blow over them, as a result of which the entire ocean will turn into fire. Thus it is correct to say that the Sun and the Moon will be put into the ocean. It is likewise correct to say that they will be put into Hell, because the entire ocean at that time will have been turned into Hell. [ Derived from Mazhari and Qurtubi ]</p><p>(1) Another meaning of Takwir is 'to fold', and the translation in the text is based on this meaning. The sense of folding the sun is that its function will come to an end, and it will lose its light. As such, it comes to mean same thing as mentioned in first interpretation. Muhammad Taqi Usmani</p>"

Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ assigns this interpretation to the word in this context. Another sense of the word is 'to fill' and a third sense of the word is 'to mix or admix'. Some commentators have interpreted it in this sense. None of these interpretations is contradictory to each other. First, the salt and sweet water are admixed and the rivers are made to flow forth into the sea; then the seas will meet together and become one and having more water; then the seas will be set on fire; and then the Sun and the Moon and the stars will be thrown into the water. Then all the water will be turned into fire which will become part of Hell. [ Mazhari ]</p>"

There are differences between the deeds and habits of believers and there are differences between the deeds and habits of disbelievers. The non-believers will be regrouped according to their essential characteristics and the Muslims too will be regrouped according to their essential characteristics as is reported in Baihaqi on the authority of Sayyidna Nu` man Ibn Bashir ؓ that Sayyidna ` Umar Ibn Khattab ؓ said that the people doing similar deeds, good or bad, will be joined together. For example, the knowledgeable persons from among the Muslims who were serving Islamic studies will be made into one group; the people who devoted themselves for worship will be made into another group; the people performing jihad will be together, and the people whose main characteristic was to spend in charities will be gathered in one place. On the other hand, those who were involved in wicked activities like thieves, robbers, adulterers will also be assembled in their respective groups. Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ based this statement on the verse of the Holy Qur'an in which Allah says in Surah [ and you will be (divided into) three categories. (56:7) It is mentioned further in that Surah that out of the three categories, two will attain salvation who are named as the 'foremost' and 'people of the right' while another group, namely the 'people of the left' will be comprised of the infidels.</p>"

      "text": "<p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَ‌سُولٍ كَرِ‌يمٍ ذِي قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِي الْعَرْ‌شِ مَكِينٍ (it [ the Qur'an ] is surely the word of a noble messenger [ Jibra'il ], the one possessing power and a high status with the Lord of the Throne...81:19-20). This is the subject of oath that affirms that Qur'an is the word brought by a noble messenger. Then three qualities are attributed to this noble messenger. The first quality is that he possesses power. The second quality is that he has high status and lofty rank with Allah, and he is obeyed in the upper realm. The third quality is that he is trusted, and there is no possibility of his committing any breach of trust or tampering with the message he conveys. The word 'noble messenger' obviously refers to the angel Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) because the word 'messenger' is used for angels as it is used for prophets, and all the three qualities attributed to the 'messenger' in the next verses are truly present in Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) .\tHis being powerful is mentioned in Surah An-Najm in the following words;</p><p>عَلَّمَهُ شَدِيدُ الْقُوَىٰ</p><p>It is taught to him by one (angel) of strong faculties.[ 53:5)</p><p>It is established through the hadith of Mi` raj that he is obeyed by other angels, because when he accompanied the Holy Prophet ﷺ to the sky and ordered the angels appointed on its doors to open them he was obeyed by them. That he is trust-worthy is too obvious to need a proof.</p><p>Some commentators, however, take the phrase 'honourable messenger' to refer to the Holy Prophet Muhammad \"and accordingly have made an attempt to take all the three qualities referring to the Holy Prophet ﷺ .</p><p>In the next verses, the Holy Qur'an has mentioned the high status of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and has refuted the silly objections raised against him by the infidels.</p><p>(And your companion [ Muhammad ﷺ ] madman....81:22) This is rebuttal to the foolish criticism of the enemies who said that Muhammad ﷺ is [ God forbid!] insane.</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَ‌آهُ بِالْأُفُقِ الْمُبِينِ (And he did see him [ Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) ] on the clear horizon. _81:23) In other words, Muhammad saw Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) on a clear horizon. A similar statement occurs in Surah An-Najm as follows:</p><p>The purpose of mentioning this is to show that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was well-acquainted with Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) the angel of revelation. He had seen him in his original shape. Therefore, there can be no room for doubt in the veracity of revelation he brings to him.</p><p>Al-hamdulillah</p><p>The Commentary on</p><p>Surah At-Takwir</p><p>Ends here</p>"
