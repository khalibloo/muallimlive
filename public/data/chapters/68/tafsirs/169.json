This is like Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ </div><p>(Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:3-5) Therefore, this statement is Allah's swearing and alerting His creatures to what He has favored them with by teaching them the skill of writing, through which knowledge is attained. Thus, Allah continues by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ</div><p>(and by what they Yastur.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said that this means, \"what they write.\" As-Suddi said, \"The angels and the deeds of the servants they record.\" Others said, \"Rather, what is meant here is the pen which Allah caused to write the decree when He wrote the decrees of all creation, and this took place fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.\" For this, they present Hadiths that have been reported about the Pen. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Al-Walid bin `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he said, \"My father called for me when he was dying and he said to me: `Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ فَقَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا أَكْتُبُ؟ قَالَ: اكْتُبِ الْقَدَرَ وَمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى الْأَبَد»</div><p>(Verily, the first of what Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it: \"Write.\" The Pen said: \"O my Lord, what shall I write\" He said: \"Write the decree and whatever will throughout eternity.\")\" This Hadith has been recorded by Imam Ahmad through various routes of transmission. At-Tirmidhi also recorded it from a Hadith of Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi and he (At-Tirmidhi) said about it, \"Hasan Sahih, Gharib.\"</p><h2>Swearing by the Pen refers to the Greatness of the Prophet</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ </div><p>(You, by the grace of your Lord, are not insane.) meaning -- and all praise is due to Allah -- `you are not crazy as the ignorant among your people claim. They are those who deny the guidance and the clear truth that you have come with. Therefore, they attribute madness to you because of it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ لَكَ لاّجْراً غَيْرَ مَمْنُونٍ </div><p>(And verily, for you will be reward that is not Mamnun.) meaning, `for you is the great reward, and abundant blessings which will never be cut off or perish, because you conveyed the Message of your Lord to creation, and you were patient with their abuse.' The meaning of:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(not Mamnun) is that it will not be cut off. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</div><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) and His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) (95:6) Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Without Mamnun) means \"Without reckoning.\" And this refers back to what we have said before.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Statement: \"Verily, You are on an Exalted Character.\"</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Verily, you are on a great religion, and it is Islam.\" Likewise said Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd also said this. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) \"It has been mentioned to us that Sa`d bin Hisham asked `A'ishah about the character of the Messenger of Allah , so she replied: `Have you not read the Qur'an' Sa`d said: `Of course.' Then she said: `Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah was the Qur'an.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded similar to this and Imam Muslim recorded it in his Sahih on the authority of Qatadah in its full length. This means that he would act according to the commands and the prohibition in the Qur'an. His nature and character were patterned according to the Qur'an, and he abandoned his natural disposition (i.e., the carnal nature). So whatever the Qur'an commanded, he did it, and whatever it forbade, he avoided it. Along with this, Allah gave him the exalted character, which included the qualities of modesty, kindness, bravery, pardoning, gentleness and every other good characteristic. This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, \"I served the Messenger of Allah for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah . And I never smelled any musk or perfume that had a better fragrance than the sweat of the Messenger of Allah.\" Imam Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"The Messenger of Allah had the most handsome face of all the people, and he had the best behavior of all of the people. And he was not tall, nor was he short.\" The Hadiths concerning this matter are numerous. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi has a complete book on this subject called Kitab Ash-Shama'il. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah never struck a servant of his with his hand, nor did he ever hit a woman. He never hit anything with his hand, except for when he was fighting Jihad in the cause of Allah. And he was never given the option between two things except that the most beloved of the two to him was the easiest of them, as long as it did not involve sin. If it did involve sin, then he stayed farther away from sin than any of the people. He would not avenge himself concerning anything that was done to him, except if the limits of Allah were transgressed. Then, in that case he would avenge for the sake of Allah.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الْأَخْلَاق»</div><p>(I have only been sent to perfect righteous behavior.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ - بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ </div><p>(You will see, and they will see, which of you is afflicted with madness.) then it means, `you will know, O Muhammad -- and those who oppose you and reject you, will know -- who is insane and misguided among you.' This is like Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ </div><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!) (54:26) Allah also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(And verily (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.) (34:24) Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas, it means \"You will know and they will know on the Day of Judgement.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ </div><p>(Which of you is Maftun (afflicted with madness) means which of you is crazy. This was also said by Mujahid and others as well. The literal meaning of Maftun is one who has been charmed or lured away from the truth and has strayed from it. Thus, the entire statement means, `so you will know and they will know,' or `you will be informed and they will be informed, as to which of you is afflicted with madness.' And Allah knows best. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ </div><p>(Verily, your Lord is the best Knower of him who has gone astray from His path, and He is the best Knower of those who are guided.) meaning, `He knows which of the two groups are truly guided among you, and He knows the party that is astray from the truth.'</p>"

The meaning of:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(not Mamnun) is that it will not be cut off. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</div><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) and His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) (95:6) Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Without Mamnun) means \"Without reckoning.\" And this refers back to what we have said before.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Statement: \"Verily, You are on an Exalted Character.\"</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Verily, you are on a great religion, and it is Islam.\" Likewise said Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd also said this. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) \"It has been mentioned to us that Sa`d bin Hisham asked `A'ishah about the character of the Messenger of Allah , so she replied: `Have you not read the Qur'an' Sa`d said: `Of course.' Then she said: `Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah was the Qur'an.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded similar to this and Imam Muslim recorded it in his Sahih on the authority of Qatadah in its full length. This means that he would act according to the commands and the prohibition in the Qur'an. His nature and character were patterned according to the Qur'an, and he abandoned his natural disposition (i.e., the carnal nature). So whatever the Qur'an commanded, he did it, and whatever it forbade, he avoided it. Along with this, Allah gave him the exalted character, which included the qualities of modesty, kindness, bravery, pardoning, gentleness and every other good characteristic. This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, \"I served the Messenger of Allah for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah . And I never smelled any musk or perfume that had a better fragrance than the sweat of the Messenger of Allah.\" Imam Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"The Messenger of Allah had the most handsome face of all the people, and he had the best behavior of all of the people. And he was not tall, nor was he short.\" The Hadiths concerning this matter are numerous. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi has a complete book on this subject called Kitab Ash-Shama'il. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah never struck a servant of his with his hand, nor did he ever hit a woman. He never hit anything with his hand, except for when he was fighting Jihad in the cause of Allah. And he was never given the option between two things except that the most beloved of the two to him was the easiest of them, as long as it did not involve sin. If it did involve sin, then he stayed farther away from sin than any of the people. He would not avenge himself concerning anything that was done to him, except if the limits of Allah were transgressed. Then, in that case he would avenge for the sake of Allah.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الْأَخْلَاق»</div><p>(I have only been sent to perfect righteous behavior.)

This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, \"I served the Messenger of Allah for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah . And I never smelled any musk or perfume that had a better fragrance than the sweat of the Messenger of Allah.\" Imam Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"The Messenger of Allah had the most handsome face of all the people, and he had the best behavior of all of the people. And he was not tall, nor was he short.\" The Hadiths concerning this matter are numerous. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi has a complete book on this subject called Kitab Ash-Shama'il. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah never struck a servant of his with his hand, nor did he ever hit a woman. He never hit anything with his hand, except for when he was fighting Jihad in the cause of Allah. And he was never given the option between two things except that the most beloved of the two to him was the easiest of them, as long as it did not involve sin. If it did involve sin, then he stayed farther away from sin than any of the people. He would not avenge himself concerning anything that was done to him, except if the limits of Allah were transgressed. Then, in that case he would avenge for the sake of Allah.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الْأَخْلَاق»</div><p>(I have only been sent to perfect righteous behavior.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ - بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ </div><p>(You will see, and they will see, which of you is afflicted with madness.) then it means, `you will know, O Muhammad -- and those who oppose you and reject you, will know -- who is insane and misguided among you.' This is like Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ </div><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!) (54:26) Allah also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(And verily (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.)

Thus, the entire statement means, `so you will know and they will know,' or `you will be informed and they will be informed, as to which of you is afflicted with madness.' And Allah knows best. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ </div><p>(Verily, your Lord is the best Knower of him who has gone astray from His path, and He is the best Knower of those who are guided.) meaning, `He knows which of the two groups are truly guided among you, and He knows the party that is astray from the truth.'</p>"

This has been dis- cussed at length previously and there is no need to repeat it here.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Pen Concerning</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْقَلَمِ</div><p>(By the pen) The apparent meaning is that this refers to the actual pen that is used to write. This is like Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ </div><p>(Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:3-5) Therefore, this statement is Allah's swearing and alerting His creatures to what He has favored them with by teaching them the skill of writing, through which knowledge is attained. Thus, Allah continues by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ</div><p>(and by what they Yastur.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said that this means, \"what they write.\" As-Suddi said, \"The angels and the deeds of the servants they record.\" Others said, \"Rather, what is meant here is the pen which Allah caused to write the decree when He wrote the decrees of all creation, and this took place fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.\" For this, they present Hadiths that have been reported about the Pen. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Al-Walid bin `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he said, \"My father called for me when he was dying and he said to me: `Verily, I heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ فَقَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا أَكْتُبُ؟ قَالَ: اكْتُبِ الْقَدَرَ وَمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى الْأَبَد»</div><p>(Verily, the first of what Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it: \"Write.\" The Pen said: \"O my Lord, what shall I write\" He said: \"Write the decree and whatever will throughout eternity.\")\" This Hadith has been recorded by Imam Ahmad through various routes of transmission. At-Tirmidhi also recorded it from a Hadith of Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi and he (At-Tirmidhi) said about it, \"Hasan Sahih, Gharib.\"</p><h2>Swearing by the Pen refers to the Greatness of the Prophet</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ </div><p>(You, by the grace of your Lord, are not insane.) meaning -- and all praise is due to Allah -- `you are not crazy as the ignorant among your people claim. They are those who deny the guidance and the clear truth that you have come with. Therefore, they attribute madness to you because of it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ لَكَ لاّجْراً غَيْرَ مَمْنُونٍ </div><p>(And verily, for you will be reward that is not Mamnun.) meaning, `for you is the great reward, and abundant blessings which will never be cut off or perish, because you conveyed the Message of your Lord to creation, and you were patient with their abuse.' The meaning of:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(not Mamnun) is that it will not be cut off. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</div><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) and His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Then they shall have a reward without end.) (95:6) Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(Without Mamnun) means \"Without reckoning.\" And this refers back to what we have said before.</p><h2>The Explanation of the Statement: \"Verily, You are on an Exalted Character.\"</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Verily, you are on a great religion, and it is Islam.\" Likewise said Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd also said this. Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, you are on an exalted (standard of) character.) \"It has been mentioned to us that Sa`d bin Hisham asked `A'ishah about the character of the Messenger of Allah , so she replied: `Have you not read the Qur'an' Sa`d said: `Of course.' Then she said: `Verily, the character of the Messenger of Allah was the Qur'an.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded similar to this and Imam Muslim recorded it in his Sahih on the authority of Qatadah in its full length. This means that he would act according to the commands and the prohibition in the Qur'an. His nature and character were patterned according to the Qur'an, and he abandoned his natural disposition (i.e., the carnal nature). So whatever the Qur'an commanded, he did it, and whatever it forbade, he avoided it. Along with this, Allah gave him the exalted character, which included the qualities of modesty, kindness, bravery, pardoning, gentleness and every other good characteristic. This is like that which has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, \"I served the Messenger of Allah for ten years, and he never said a word of displeasure to me (Uff), nor did he ever say to me concerning something I had done: `Why did you do that' And he never said to me concerning something I had not done: `Why didn't you do this' He had the best character, and I never touched any silk or anything else that was softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allah .

When he swears by Allah, he fulfills his oath. Shall I inform you of the people of the Fire Every `Utul (cruel person), Jawwaz and arrogant person.) Al-Waki` said, \"It (`Utul) is every Jawwaz, Ja`zari and arrogant person.\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this in their Two Sahihs, as well as the rest of the Group, except for Abu Dawud. All of its routes of transmission are by way of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah who both reported it from Sa`id bin Khalid. The scholars of Arabic language have said that Ja`zari means rude and harsh, while Jawwaz means greedy and stingy. Concerning the word Zanim, Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُتُلٍّ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ زَنِيمٍ </div><p>(`Utul (cruel), and moreover Zanim.) \"A man from the Quraysh who stands out among them like the sheep that has had a piece of its ear cut off.\" The meaning of this is that he is famous for his evil just as a sheep that has a piece of its ear cut off stands out among its sister sheep. In the Arabic language the Zanim is a person who is adopted among a group of people (i.e., he is not truly of them). Ibn Jarir and others among the Imams have said this. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن كَانَ ذَا مَالٍ وَبَنِينَ - إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالَ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>((He was so) because he had wealth and children. When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: \"Tales of the men of old!\") Allah is saying, `this is how he responds to the favors that Allah has bestowed upon him of wealth and children, by disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and turning away from them while claiming that they are a lie that has been taken from the tales of the ancients.' This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً - وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً - وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً - وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً - ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً - سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً - إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ - فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ نَظَرَ - ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ - فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ - إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ - سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ - لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ - لَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ - عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ </div><p>(Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely (without any wealth and children etc.).

And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted! Then he thought. Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way. Then he turned back, and was proud. Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic from that of old, this is nothing but the word of a human being!\" I will cast him into Hellfire. And what will make you know what Hellfire is It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburned)! Burning and blackening the skins!

He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَن سَاقٍ وَيُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى السُّجُودِ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ </div><p>(The Day when the Shin shall be laid bare and they shall be called to prostrate themselves, but they shall not be able to do so.) meaning, the Day of Judgement and the horrors, earthquakes, trials, tests and great matters that will occur during it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that he heard the Prophet saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَكْشِفُ رَبُّنَا عَنْ سَاقِهِ، فَيَسْجُدُ لَهُ كُلُّ مُؤْمِنٍ وَمُؤْمِنَةٍ، وَيَبْقَى مَنْ كَانَ يَسْجُدُ فِي الدُّنْيَا رِيَاءً وَسُمْعَةً، فَيَذْهَبُ لِيَسْجُدَ، فَيَعُودُ ظَهْرُهُ طَبَقًا وَاحِدًا»</div><p>(Our Lord will reveal His Shin, and every believing male and female will prostrate to Him. The only people who will remain standing are those who prostrated in the worldly life only to be seen and heard (showing off). This type of person will try to prostrate at that time, but his back will made to be one stiff plate (the bone will not bend or flex).)\" This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs and other books from different routes of transmission with various wordings. It is a long Hadith that is very popular. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـشِعَةً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ</div><p>(Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them;) means, in the final abode, due to their crimes and arrogance in the worldly life. Thus they will be punished with the opposite of what they did. When they were called to prostrate in the worldly life, they refused to do so even though they were healthy and secure. Therefore, they will be punished with the lack of ability to do so in the Hereafter. When the Almighty Lord makes Himself visible (before the believers), then the believers will fall down in prostration to Him, but no one of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be able to prostrate. rather, their backs will become one plate. Everytime one of them attempts to prostrate, he will bow his neck but will not be able to prostrate. This is just like in the life of this world, when these people were in opposition to what the believers were doing.</p><h2>For Whoever denies the Qur'an</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْنِى وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ</div><p>(Then leave Me alone with such as belie this narration.) meaning, the Qur'an. This is a sever threat which means, `leave Me alone with this person; I know about him and how I will gradually punish him and increase him in his falsehood. I am giving him respite for a while, then I will seize him with a mighty and powerful punishment.' Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.) meaning, and they will not even be aware of it. Rather, they will believe that it is a noble blessing from Allah, but really the same matter is actually a form of humiliation (for them). This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them, We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55,56) Allah also said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ </div><p>(So, when they forgot that which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We punished them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) Therefore, Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُمْلِى لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ </div><p>(And I will grant them a respite. Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `I will delay them, give them respite and extend their time. Yet, this is My plan, and My plot against them.' Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ</div><p>(Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `great against whoever opposes My command, rejects My Messengers and dares to disobey Me.' In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from the Messenger of Allah that he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتْى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</div><p>(Verily Allah the Exalted gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then he recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) (11:102) In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ تَسْـَلُهُمْ أَجْراً فَهُم مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ - أَمْ عِندَهُمُ الْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ </div><p>(Or is it that you ask them for a wage, so that they are heavily burdened with debt Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down) the explanation of these two Ayat prece- ded in Surat At-Tur. The meaning of it is, `you, O Muhammad, call them to Allah without taking any wages from them. rather, you hope for the reward with Allah. Yet, they reject that which you have brought to them simply due to ignorance, disbelief and obstinacy.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُن كَصَـحِبِ الْحُوتِ إِذْ نَادَى وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ </div>"

Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـشِعَةً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ</div><p>(Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them;) means, in the final abode, due to their crimes and arrogance in the worldly life. Thus they will be punished with the opposite of what they did. When they were called to prostrate in the worldly life, they refused to do so even though they were healthy and secure. Therefore, they will be punished with the lack of ability to do so in the Hereafter. When the Almighty Lord makes Himself visible (before the believers), then the believers will fall down in prostration to Him, but no one of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be able to prostrate. rather, their backs will become one plate. Everytime one of them attempts to prostrate, he will bow his neck but will not be able to prostrate. This is just like in the life of this world, when these people were in opposition to what the believers were doing.</p><h2>For Whoever denies the Qur'an</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْنِى وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ</div><p>(Then leave Me alone with such as belie this narration.) meaning, the Qur'an. This is a sever threat which means, `leave Me alone with this person; I know about him and how I will gradually punish him and increase him in his falsehood. I am giving him respite for a while, then I will seize him with a mighty and powerful punishment.' Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.) meaning, and they will not even be aware of it. Rather, they will believe that it is a noble blessing from Allah, but really the same matter is actually a form of humiliation (for them). This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them, We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55,56) Allah also said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ </div><p>(So, when they forgot that which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We punished them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) Therefore, Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُمْلِى لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ </div><p>(And I will grant them a respite. Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `I will delay them, give them respite and extend their time. Yet, this is My plan, and My plot against them.' Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ كَيْدِى مَتِينٌ</div><p>(Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `great against whoever opposes My command, rejects My Messengers and dares to disobey Me.' In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from the Messenger of Allah that he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتْى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</div><p>(Verily Allah the Exalted gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then he recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) (11:102) In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ تَسْـَلُهُمْ أَجْراً فَهُم مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ - أَمْ عِندَهُمُ الْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ </div><p>(Or is it that you ask them for a wage, so that they are heavily burdened with debt Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down) the explanation of these two Ayat prece- ded in Surat At-Tur. The meaning of it is, `you, O Muhammad, call them to Allah without taking any wages from them. rather, you hope for the reward with Allah. Yet, they reject that which you have brought to them simply due to ignorance, disbelief and obstinacy.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُن كَصَـحِبِ الْحُوتِ إِذْ نَادَى وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ </div>"

Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Abu `Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</div><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.) This is how Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. Imam Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih on the authority of Buraydah himself, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet . There is a story concerning this incident (as reported by Buraydah in Sahih Muslim), and At-Tirmidhi recorded the Hadith in this manner (like Muslim's version). This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of `Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet . `Imran's wording is,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</div><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)\" Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ وَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ سَابَقَ الْقَدَرَ سَبَقَتِ الْعَيْنُ وَإِذَا اسْتُغْسِلْتُمْ فَاغْسِلُوا»</div><p>(The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree (and change it), then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform Ghusl (to remove the evil eye) then wash well.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (his grandsons) by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُعِيذُكُمَا بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ، وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّة»</div><p>(I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil.)

So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him (the Prophet ) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ تَتَّهِمُونَ بِهِ؟»</div><p>(Who do you blame (or hold responsible) for this) The people replied, \"\"Amir bin Rabi`ah.\" Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ؟ إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيَدْعُ لَهُ بِالْبَرَكَة»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him.) Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, \"The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.\" An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, \"And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans. Then when the Mu`awwidhatan were revealed, he used them (for seeking protection) and abandoned everything else. This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan.\"</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</h2><p>Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَم»</div><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</div><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud.

This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `A'ishah</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟»</div><p>(Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْتَسِلْ لَه»</div><p>(Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا»</div><p>(O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain.) He (Sahl) then stood up, and Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ، أَوْ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ، أَوْ مِنْ مَالِهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ، فَلْيُبَرِّكْ فَإِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَق»</div><p>(If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real.)</p><h2>The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ</div><p>(and they say: \"Verily, he is a madman!\") meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, \"Verily, he is a madman.\" They say this because he came with the Qur'an. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ </div><p>(But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures (`Alamin).) This is the end of the explanation (Tafsir) of Surah Nun (or Al-Qalam), and all praise and blessing belong to Allah.</p>"

This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of `Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet . `Imran's wording is,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</div><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)\" Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ وَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ سَابَقَ الْقَدَرَ سَبَقَتِ الْعَيْنُ وَإِذَا اسْتُغْسِلْتُمْ فَاغْسِلُوا»</div><p>(The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree (and change it), then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform Ghusl (to remove the evil eye) then wash well.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (his grandsons) by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُعِيذُكُمَا بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ، وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّة»</div><p>(I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil.) Then he would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَكَذَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يُعَوِّذُ إِسْحَاقَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلَام»</div><p>(Thus, did Ibrahim used to seek protection for Ishaq and Isma`il (his sons).)\" This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers.</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf that `Amir bin Rabi`ah passed by Sahl bin Hunayf while he was bathing and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today (i.e., commenting on how nice Sahl's skin was).\" So he did not leave before he (Sahl) fell down on the ground. So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him (the Prophet ) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ تَتَّهِمُونَ بِهِ؟»</div><p>(Who do you blame (or hold responsible) for this) The people replied, \"\"Amir bin Rabi`ah.\" Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ؟ إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيَدْعُ لَهُ بِالْبَرَكَة»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him.) Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, \"The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.\" An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, \"And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans.

At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan.\"</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</h2><p>Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَم»</div><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</div><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud.

This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `A'ishah</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟»</div><p>(Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْتَسِلْ لَه»</div><p>(Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا»</div><p>(O Allah!

Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ </div><p>(But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures (`Alamin).)

Various things happened to him, such as riding on a ship at sea, being swallowed by a (large) fish, the fish carrying him off into the ocean, being in the darkness and depth of the sea and hearing the sea's and its dwellers glorification of the Most High, the Most Able (Allah). For He (Allah) is the One Whose execution of divine decree cannot be resisted. After all of this, he (Yunus) called out from the layers of darkness,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(\"That none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) are You!

Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Abu `Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَة»</div><p>(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)

So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him (the Prophet ) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure.

Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, \"The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.\" An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, \"And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans.

This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟»</div><p>(Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْتَسِلْ لَه»</div><p>(Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins.

At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan.\"</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</h2><p>Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَم»</div><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</div><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ، اللهُ يَشْفِيك»</div><p>(In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.)</p><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment\" The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَم»</div><p>(Yes).\" Then Jibril said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيك»</div><p>(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\") This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ، اللهُ يَشْفِيك»</div><p>(In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.)</p><h2>The Hadith of Asma' bint `Umays</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubayd bin Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi that Asma' said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Bani Ja`far are afflicted with the evil eye; should I seek to have Ruqyah \" The Prophet replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ فَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ يَسْبِقُ الْقَدَرَ لَسَبَقَتْهُ الْعَيْن»</div><p>(Yes, for if anything could overcome the divine decree, it would be the evil eye.) This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `A'ishah</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟»</div><p>(Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟»</div><p>(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْتَسِلْ لَه»</div><p>(Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, \"`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا»</div><p>(O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain.) He (Sahl) then stood up, and Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ، أَوْ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ، أَوْ مِنْ مَالِهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ، فَلْيُبَرِّكْ فَإِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَق»</div><p>(If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real.)</p><h2>The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</h2><p>Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ</div><p>(and they say: \"Verily, he is a madman!\") meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, \"Verily, he is a madman.\" They say this because he came with the Qur'an. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ </div><p>(But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures (`Alamin).) This is the end of the explanation (Tafsir) of Surah Nun (or Al-Qalam), and all praise and blessing belong to Allah.</p>"
