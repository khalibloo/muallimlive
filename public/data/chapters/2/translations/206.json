      "text": "O you who believe, when you contract a debt among yourselves for a fixed period of time, write it down, and let the scribe write it between you with fairness. The scribe whom Allah has taught should not refuse to write, so let him write, and let the debtor dictate, but he should fear Allah his Lord, and not diminish anything out of it. If the debtor is feeble-minded, weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate fairly, and bring two witnesses from among your men; if two men are not available, then one man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses – so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned. Do not be reluctant to write down your debts, whether the amount is small or large, for a fixed period of time; that is more equitable in the sight of Allah, and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubts among yourselves. However, if you are conducting a transaction on the spot between yourselves, there is no blame upon you not to write it, but take witnesses whenever you trade with one another. Neither a scribe nor a witness should suffer harm, for if you do cause them harm, it is indeed a sin on your part. So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything."
