It is not righteousness or goodness that you come to houses from the rear wearing your iḥrām for Hajj or Umrah, as they used to claim during the time of ignorance before Islam. Rather, true righteousness is the righteousness of whoever is mindful, outwardly and inwardly. So, enter houses from their correct doors, because it is easier for you and less troublesome. Allah does not overburden you with difficulty, so protect yourself from the punishment of Allah by doing good, in order that you may be successful in achieving what you wish for, and in escaping from what you fear."

If you are prevented from completing them by illness or an enemy, then you should sacrifice what is easily available of sacrificial animals, such as camels, cows or sheep, before you take off your Iḥrām, and do not shave your heads or cut your hair until the sacrificial animals have reached their place. If you are prevented from entering the Sacred Sanctuary, then perform the sacrifice wherever you have stopped; yet if you can enter it, then do it on the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah) or at least within the days of tashrīq (11, 12 and 13 of Dhū Al-Ḥijjah). Whoever among you is ill or has some problem with his hair or his head, like lice or something similar, whoever shaved his head for that reason, then that is not a problem; but they should instead fast for three days, or feed six poor people from the area of the Sanctuary, or sacrifice a sheep to be distributed among the poor of the Sanctuary. If you are living in times of peace, then whoever takes the opportunity to perform Umrah in the months of Hajj, enjoying in between those things that are not allowed when performing the pilgrimages, they should sacrifice whatever is easily available: a sheep, or a seventh of a camel or cow. If they are unable to make a sacrifice, then they must fast for three days during the days of Hajj to make up for it, and seven more days when they return home, making ten days all together. This practice of having a break between Umrah and Hajj and sacrificing an animal or fasting for those unable to make a sacrifice is only for people who do not live within or close to the Sanctuary of the Sacred Mosque. As for those who live within the Sanctuary or close to it, they do not do this, because they have no need to due to their constant being there and enjoying being able to make Umrah or Tawaf freely any other time of the year.

If two men are not found, then call one man and two women whose religion and honesty you are satisfied with, so that if one of the women forgets, the other can remind her. The witness should not refuse to be a witness to a debt and must testify if required.
