The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي إِذْ سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاءَ، قَاعِدٌ عَلَى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي. فَأَنْزَلَ (اللهُ تَعَالى):</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاهْجُرْ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»</div><p>(While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky and saw the same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him (in fear) until I fell down to the ground. Then, I went to my family and I said, `Wrap me up, wrap me up. So, they wrapped me up! So Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn!) until (And keep away) Here, Abu Salamah added, `Ar-Rujz means idols.' (After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this. This is due to the Prophet's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاء»</div><p>(The same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'.)\" That angel was Jibril, who had came to him with Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ - خَلَقَ الإِنسَـنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ - اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ </div><p>(Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created. He has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ثُمَّ فَتَرَ الْوَحْيُ عَنِّي فَتْرَةً، فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي، قَاعِدٌ عَلى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ فَرَقًا حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي، فَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ تَعَالى:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»</div><p>(Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri. At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ - وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ - وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ </div><p>(O you enveloped in garments! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord (Allah)! And purify your garments! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)! And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of obedience to Allah as a favour to Him). And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e., perform your duty to Allah)!) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ </div><p>(Arise and warn!) means, prepare to go forth with zeal and warn the people. With this the Prophet attained messengership just as he attained prophethood with the first revelation.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ </div><p>(And magnify your Lord!) to declare the greatness of Him. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ </div><p>(And purify your garments!) \"This means, do not let your garments that you wear be from earnings that are unlawful.\" It has also been said, \"Do not wear your clothes in disobedience.\" Muhammad bin Sirin said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ </div><p>(And purify your garments!) \"This means clean them with water.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The idolators would not clean themselves, so Allah commanded him to clean himself and his garments.\" This view was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ </div><p>(And purify your garments!) \"This means purify your heart and your intentions.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, \"And beautify your character.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ </div><p>(And keep away from Ar-Rujz!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Ar-Rujz are idols, so keep away from them.\" Similar to this was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd, \"Verily, it is the idols.\" This is like Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا النَّبِىِّ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُطِعِ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ</div><p>(O Prophet! have Taqwa of Allah, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites.) (33:1) and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ مُوسَى لاًّخِيهِ هَـرُونَ اخْلُفْنِى فِى قَوْمِى وَأَصْلِحْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</div><p>(And Musa said to his brother Harun: \"Replace me among my people, act well and follow not way of the corrupters.\") (7:142) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ </div><p>(And give not a thing in order to have more.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Do not give any gift seeking to get (back in return) more than it.\" Khusayf reported from Mujahid;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ </div><p>(And give not a thing (Tamnun) in order to have more.) \"Do not slacken in seeking more good. Tamnun in the language of the Arabs means to become weak.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ </div><p>(And be patient for the sake of your Lord!) meaning, make your patience with their harms be for the Face of your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. This was stated by Mujahid. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"Be patient in your giving for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.\"</p><h2>Reminding of the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ </div><p>(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Zayd bin Aslam, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd, all said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">النَّاقُورِ</div><p>(Naqur) \"It is the Trumpet.\" Mujahid said, \"It is in the shape of a horn.\" Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Ashaj told them that Asbat bin Muhammad related to them from Mutarrif, from `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, from Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ </div><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is sounded.) The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُؤْمَرُ فَيَنْفُخُ؟»</div><p>(How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn has placed it in his mouth, leaned his forehead forward, and is waiting to be commanded so that he can blow) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, \"What do you command us, O Messenger of Allah\" He replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا: حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ، عَلَى اللهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا»</div><p>(Say: \"Allah is sufficient for us, and what an excellent Trustee He is. We put our trust in Allah.\") It has been recorded like this by Imam Ahmad on the authority of Asbat. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ </div><p>(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day.) meaning, severe.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ </div><p>(Far from easy for the disbelievers.) meaning, it will not be easy for them. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</div><p>(The disbelievers will say: \"This a Hard Day.\") (54:8) We have reported from Zurarah bin Awfa, the judge of Al-Basrah, that he lead the people in the morning prayer and he recited this Surah. Then, when he reached Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ </div><p>(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers.) he made a moaning sound and then he fell down dead. May Allah have mercy on him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً - وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً - وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً - وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً - ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً - سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً - إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ - فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ نَظَرَ - ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ - فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ - إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ - سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ - لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ </div>"

The person who is mentioned in this discussion is Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah Al-Makhzumi. He was one of the chiefs of the Quraysh -- may Allah curse him. Among the narrations about this is what was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً </div><p>(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ </div><p>(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry. Verily, it has a sweetness and it is truly elegant. Verily, it is exalted and it is not overcome. And I have no doubt that it is magic.' So Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ </div><p>(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ </div><p>(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.)

When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً </div><p>(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ </div><p>(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry. Verily, it has a sweetness and it is truly elegant. Verily, it is exalted and it is not overcome. And I have no doubt that it is magic.' So Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ </div><p>(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ </div><p>(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.)

Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ </div><p>(And what will make you know (exactly) what Saqar is) This is to give fright and emphasis to its matter.

Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.'

So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him.

Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.'

When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً </div><p>(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ </div><p>(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry. Verily, it has a sweetness and it is truly elegant. Verily, it is exalted and it is not overcome. And I have no doubt that it is magic.' So Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ </div><p>(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ </div><p>(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.)

Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ </div><p>(And what will make you know (exactly) what Saqar is) This is to give fright and emphasis to its matter.

Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.'

Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.'

This has a profound wisdom and it is an irrefutable proof. None knows the Soldiers of Allah except Him Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He.) meaning, none knows their number and their count except Allah. This is so that one does not make the mistake of thinking that they are only nineteen in all. It has been confirmed in the Hadith concerning Al-Isra' that is reported in the Two Sahihs and other collections, that the Messenger of Allah said in describing the Frequented House (Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur), which is in the seventh heaven,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</div><p>(Seventy thousand angels enter into it every day and they do not return to it as it is all that is due upon them (one visit in their lifetime).)

This refers to the Hellfire. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others of the Salaf, all said this.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَذِيراً لِّلْبَشَرِ - لِمَن شَآءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَتَقَدَّمَ أَوْ يَتَأَخَّرَ </div><p>(A warning to mankind -- to any of you that chooses to go forward, or to remain behind.) meaning, for whoever wishes to accept the warning and be guided to the truth, or hold back from accepting it, turn away from it and reject it.</p>"
