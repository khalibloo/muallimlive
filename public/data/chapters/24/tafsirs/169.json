This honorable Ayah contains the ruling on the law of retaliation for the person who commits illegal sex, and details of the punishment. Such a person will either be unmarried, meaning that he has never been married, or he will be married, meaning that he has had intercourse within the bounds of a lawful marriage, and he is free, adult and of sound mind. As for the virgin who is unwedded, the prescribed punishment is one hundred stripes, as stated in this Ayah. In addition to this he is to be banished from his homeland for one year, as was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah and Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani in the Hadith about the two bedouins who came to the Messenger of Allah . One of them said, \"O Messenger of Allah, this son of mine was employed by this man, and committed Zina with his wife. I paid a ransom with him on behalf of my son one hundred sheep and a slave-girl, but when I asked the people of knowledge, they said that my son should be given one hundred stripes and banished for a year, and that this man's wife should be stoned to death.\" The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَأَقْضِيَنَّ بَيْنَكُمَا بِكِتَابِ اللهِ تَعَالى، الْوَلِيدَةُ وَالْغَنَمُ رَدٌّ عَلَيْكَ، وَعَلى ابْنِكَ جَلْدُ مِائَةٍ وَتَغْرِيبُ عَامٍ، وَاغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ لِرَجُلٍ مِنْ أَسْلَمَ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ هذَا،فَإِنِ اعْتَرَفَتْ فَارْجُمْهَا»</div><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will judge between you both according to the Book of Allah. Take back the slave-girl and sheep, and your son is to be given one hundred stripes and banished for one year. O Unays -- he said to a man from the tribe of Aslam -- go to this man's wife, and if she confesses, then stone her to death.) Unays went to her and she confessed, so he stoned her to death. This indicates that if the person who is guilty of illegal sex is a virgin and unmarried, he should be banished in addition to being given one hundred stripes. But if married, meaning he has had intercourse within the bounds of lawful marriage, and he is free, adult and of sound mind, then he should be stoned to death. Imam Malik recorded that `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and praised and glorified Allah, then he said; \"O people! Allah sent Muhammad with the truth, and revealed to him the Book. One of the things that was revealed to him was the Ayah of stoning to death, which we have recited and understood. The Messenger of Allah carried out the punishment of stoning and after him we did so, but I am afraid that as time goes by, some will say that they did not find the Ayah of stoning in the Book of Allah, and they will go astray because they abandoned one of the obligations revealed by Allah. Stoning is something that is prescribed in the Book of Allah for the person -- man or woman -- who commits illegal sex, if he or she is married, if decisive evidence is produced, or if pregnancy results from that, or if they confess to it.\" It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs in the lengthy Hadith of Malik, from which we have quoted briefly only the portion that is relevant to the current discussion.</p><h2>Do not feel pity for Them when carrying out the Prescribed Punishment</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah,) Meaning, with a ruling prescribed by Allah. So the meaning of the Ayah is: \"Do not feel too sorry for them where the laws of Allah are established.\" This does not mean that we should not naturally feel pity when carrying out the punishment. What is prohibited here is the kind of pity that may make the judge ignore the punishment altogether. This is what is not permitted for the judge. Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah,) \"If the matter is taken to the ruling authority, the punishment has to be carried out and cannot be stopped.\" This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and `Ata' bin Abi Rabah. It was recorded in a Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَعَافَوُا الْحُدُودَ فِيمَا بَيْنَكُمْ، فَمَا بَلَغَنِي مِنْ حَدَ فَقَدْ وَجَبَ»</div><p>(Compromise with the matter of prescribed punishment mutually sorting it out among yourselves, for once a matter where the prescribed punishment is required reaches me, I am obliged to carry it out.)

In Al-Musnad, it was recorded that one of the Companions said, \"O Messenger of Allah, when I slaughter a sheep I feel pity for it.\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَلَكَ فِي ذلِكَ أَجْرٌ»</div><p>(You be rewarded for that.)</p><h2>Carry out the Prescribed Punishment in Public</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.) This is more humiliating for the people who are guilty of illegal sex, if they are flogged in front of the people. This is because it is more effective as a deterrent and it conveys the sense of scandal and rebuke. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.) \"Publicly.\"</p>"

If a husband has accused his wife but cannot come up with proof, he can swear the Li`an (the oath of condemnation) as Allah commanded. This means that he brings her before the Imam and states what he is accusing her of. The ruler then asks him to swear four times by Allah in front of four witnesses</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) in his accusation of her adultery.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie.) If he says that, then she is divorced from him by the very act of this Li`an; she is forever forbidden for him and he must give her Mahr to her. The punishment for Zina should be carried out on her, and nothing can prevent the punishment except if she also swears the oath of condemnation (Li`an) and swears by Allah four times that he is one of those who lied, i.e., in what he is accusing her of;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; should be that the crath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ</div><p>(But she shall avert the punishment) meaning, the prescribed punishment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ أَن تَشْهَدَ أَرْبَعَ شَهَادَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ - وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(if she bears witness four times by Allah, that he is telling a lie. And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) The wrath of Allah is mentioned specially in the case of the woman, because usually a man would not go to the extent of exposing his wife and accusing her of Zina unless he is telling the truth and has good reason to do this, and she knows that what he is accusing her of is true. So in her case the fifth testimony calls for the wrath of Allah to be upon her, for the one upon whom is the wrath of Allah, is the one who knows the truth yet deviates from it. Then Allah mentions His grace and kindness to His creation in that He has prescribed for them a way out of their difficulties. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ</div><p>(And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you!) meaning, many of your affairs would have been too difficult for you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ</div><p>(And that Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance,) means, from His servants, even if that comes after they have sworn a confirmed oath.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(the All-Wise. ) in what He prescribes and commands and forbids. There are Hadiths which explain how we are to put this Ayah into effect, why it was revealed and concerning whom among the Companions it was revealed.</p><h2>The Reason why the Ayah of Li`an was revealed</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: \"When the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً</div><p>(And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever) 24:4 was revealed, Sa`d bin `Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, -- the leader of the Ansar -- said, `Is this how it was revealed, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْصَارِ أَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ مَا يَقُولُ سَيِّدُكُمْ؟»</div><p>(O Ansar, did you hear what your leader said) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, do not blame him, for he is a jealous man. By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin, and he never divorced a woman but none of us would dare to marry her because he is so jealous.' Sa`d said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I know that it (the Ayah) is true and is from Allah, but I am surprised. If I found some wicked man lying down with my wife, should I not disturb him until I have brought four witnesses By Allah, he would have finished what he was doing before I could bring them!' A little while later, Hilal bin Umayyah -- one of the three whose repentance had been accepted -- came back from his lands at night and found a man with his wife. He saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, but he did not disturb him until the morning. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I came to my wife at night and found a man with her, and I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.' The Messenger of Allah did not like what he had said and got very upset. The Ansar gathered around him and said, `We were being tested by what Sa`d bin Ubadah said, and now the Messenger of Allah will punish Hilal bin Umayyah and declare his testimony before people to be unacceptable.' Hilal said: `By Allah, I hope that Allah will make for me a way out from this problem.' Hilal said, `O Messenger of Allah, I see how upset you are by what I have said, but Allah knows that I am telling the truth.' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah wanted to have him flogged, but then Allah sent revelation to His Messenger . When the revelation came upon him, they knew about it from the change in his face, so they would leave him alone until the revelation was finished. Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَـدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَـدَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah...,) Then the revelation was finished and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْشِرْ يَا هِلَالُ فَقَدْ جَعَلَ اللهُ لَكَ فَرَجًا وَمَخْرَجًا»</div><p>(Rejoice, O Hilal, for Allah has made a way out for you.) Hilal said, `I had been hoping for this from my Lord, may He be glorified.' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرْسِلُوا إِلَيْهَا»</div><p>(Send for her.) So they sent for her and she came. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah to them both, and reminded them that the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe than the punishment in this world. Hilal said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I have spoken the truth about her.' She said, `He is lying.' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَاعِنُوا بَيْنَهُمَا»</div><p>(Make them both swear the Li`an.) So Hilal was told, `Testify.' So he testified four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth. When he came to the fifth testimony, he was told, `O Hilal, have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' He said, `By Allah, Allah will not punish me for it, just as He has not caused me to be flogged for it.' So he testified for the fifth time that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he was telling a lie. Then it was said to his wife, `Testify four times by Allah that he is telling a lie.' And when his wife reached the fifth testimony, she was told, `Have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' She hesitated for a while, and was about to admit her guilt, then she said: `By Allah, I will not expose my people to shame, and she swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth.' Then the Messenger of Allah separated them, and decreed that her child should not be attributed to any father, nor should the child be accused, and whoever accused her or her child, they would be subject to punishment. He also decreed that Hilal was not obliged to house her or feed her, because they had not been separated by divorce, nor had he died and left her a widow. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أُصَيْهِبَ (أُرَيْسِحَ) حَمْشَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِهِلَالٍ، وَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَوْرَقَ جَعَدًا جُمَالِيًّا خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِلَّذِي رُمِيَتْتِبهِ»</div><p>(If she gives birth to a red-haired child (with skinny thighs) and thin legs, then he is Hilal's child, but if she gives birth to a curly-haired child with thick legs and plump buttocks, then this is what she is accused of.) She subsequently gave birth to a child who was curly-haired with thick legs and plump buttocks, and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا الْأَيْمَانُ لَكَانَ لِي وَلَهَا شَأْنٌ»</div><p>(Were it not for the oath that she swore, I would deal with her.)\" `Ikrimah said, \"The child grew up to become the governor of Egypt, and he was given his mother's name and was not attributed to any father.\" Abu Dawud recorded a similar but briefer report. This Hadith has corroborating reports in the books of Sahih and elsewhere, with many chains of narration, including the report narrated by Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas, that Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife before the Prophet with Sharik bin Sahma'. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ أَوْحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence or the punishment on your back.) He said, \"O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us saw a man with his wife, how could he go and get evidence\" The Prophet again said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ وَإِلَّاحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence otherwise the punishment on your back.) Hilal said, \"By the One Who sent you with the truth! I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal something that will protect my back from the punishment. \" Then Jibril came down and brought the revelation,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) Then he recited until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) 24:6. When the revelation had finished, the Prophet sent for them both. Hilal came and gave his testimony, and the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمَا كَاذِبٌ، فَهَلْ مِنْكُمَا تَائِبٌ؟»</div><p>(Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent) Then she stood up and gave her testimony, and when she reached the fifth oath, they stopped her and said, \"If you swear the fifth oath and you are lying, the curse of Allah will be inevitable.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"She hesitated and kept quiet until we thought that she had changed her mind, then she said, `I will not dishonor my people today', and she went ahead. Then the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْصِرُوهَا، فَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَكْحَلَ الْعَيْنَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِشَرِيكِ ابْنِ سَحْمَاءَ»</div><p>(Wait until she gives birth, and if she gives birth to a child whose eyes look as if they are ringed with kohl and who has plump buttocks and thick legs, then he is the child of Sharik bin Sahma'.) She gave birth to a child who matched this description, and the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا مَا مَضَى مِنْ كِتَابِ اللهِ لَكَانَ لِي وَ لَهَا شَأْنٌ»</div><p>(Were it not for the Book of Allah, I would deal with her.) This version was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, but the event has been narrated with additional chains of narration from Ibn `Abbas and others. Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: During the governorship of Ibn Az-Zubayr I was asked about the couple who engage in Li`an, and whether they should be separated, and I did not know the answer. I got up and went to the house of Ibn `Umar, and said, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman, should the couple who engage in Li`an be separated\" He said, \"Subhan Allah, the first one to ask about this was so-and-so the son of so-and-so. He said, `O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of a man who sees his wife committing an immoral sin If he speaks he will be speaking about something very serious, and if he keeps quiet he will be keeping quiet about something very serious.' The Prophet  kept quiet and did not answer him. Later on, he came to him and said, `What I asked you about is something with which I myself being tested with.' Then Allah revealed the Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) He started to advise the man and remind him about Allah, and told him that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The man said: `By the One Who sent you with the truth, I was not telling you a lie.' Then the Prophet turned to the woman and advised the woman and reminded her about Allah, and told her that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The woman said, `By the One Who sent you with the truth, he is lying.' So the Prophet  started with the man, who swore four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth, and swore the fifth oath that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he were lying. Then he turned to the woman, who swore four times by Allah that he was lying, and swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth. Then he separated them.\" It was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Two Sahihs.</p>"

If a husband has accused his wife but cannot come up with proof, he can swear the Li`an (the oath of condemnation) as Allah commanded. This means that he brings her before the Imam and states what he is accusing her of. The ruler then asks him to swear four times by Allah in front of four witnesses</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) in his accusation of her adultery.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie.) If he says that, then she is divorced from him by the very act of this Li`an; she is forever forbidden for him and he must give her Mahr to her. The punishment for Zina should be carried out on her, and nothing can prevent the punishment except if she also swears the oath of condemnation (Li`an) and swears by Allah four times that he is one of those who lied, i.e., in what he is accusing her of;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; should be that the crath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.)

And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) The wrath of Allah is mentioned specially in the case of the woman, because usually a man would not go to the extent of exposing his wife and accusing her of Zina unless he is telling the truth and has good reason to do this, and she knows that what he is accusing her of is true. So in her case the fifth testimony calls for the wrath of Allah to be upon her, for the one upon whom is the wrath of Allah, is the one who knows the truth yet deviates from it. Then Allah mentions His grace and kindness to His creation in that He has prescribed for them a way out of their difficulties. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ</div><p>(And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you!) meaning, many of your affairs would have been too difficult for you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ</div><p>(And that Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance,) means, from His servants, even if that comes after they have sworn a confirmed oath.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(the All-Wise. ) in what He prescribes and commands and forbids. There are Hadiths which explain how we are to put this Ayah into effect, why it was revealed and concerning whom among the Companions it was revealed.</p><h2>The Reason why the Ayah of Li`an was revealed</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: \"When the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً</div><p>(And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever) 24:4 was revealed, Sa`d bin `Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, -- the leader of the Ansar -- said, `Is this how it was revealed, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْصَارِ أَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ مَا يَقُولُ سَيِّدُكُمْ؟»</div><p>(O Ansar, did you hear what your leader said) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, do not blame him, for he is a jealous man. By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin, and he never divorced a woman but none of us would dare to marry her because he is so jealous.' Sa`d said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I know that it (the Ayah) is true and is from Allah, but I am surprised. If I found some wicked man lying down with my wife, should I not disturb him until I have brought four witnesses By Allah, he would have finished what he was doing before I could bring them!' A little while later, Hilal bin Umayyah -- one of the three whose repentance had been accepted -- came back from his lands at night and found a man with his wife. He saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, but he did not disturb him until the morning. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I came to my wife at night and found a man with her, and I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.' The Messenger of Allah did not like what he had said and got very upset. The Ansar gathered around him and said, `We were being tested by what Sa`d bin Ubadah said, and now the Messenger of Allah will punish Hilal bin Umayyah and declare his testimony before people to be unacceptable.' Hilal said: `By Allah, I hope that Allah will make for me a way out from this problem.' Hilal said, `O Messenger of Allah, I see how upset you are by what I have said, but Allah knows that I am telling the truth.' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah wanted to have him flogged, but then Allah sent revelation to His Messenger . When the revelation came upon him, they knew about it from the change in his face, so they would leave him alone until the revelation was finished. Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَـدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَـدَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah...,) Then the revelation was finished and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْشِرْ يَا هِلَالُ فَقَدْ جَعَلَ اللهُ لَكَ فَرَجًا وَمَخْرَجًا»</div><p>(Rejoice, O Hilal, for Allah has made a way out for you.) Hilal said, `I had been hoping for this from my Lord, may He be glorified.' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرْسِلُوا إِلَيْهَا»</div><p>(Send for her.) So they sent for her and she came. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah to them both, and reminded them that the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe than the punishment in this world. Hilal said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I have spoken the truth about her.' She said, `He is lying.' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَاعِنُوا بَيْنَهُمَا»</div><p>(Make them both swear the Li`an.) So Hilal was told, `Testify.'

There are Hadiths which explain how we are to put this Ayah into effect, why it was revealed and concerning whom among the Companions it was revealed.</p><h2>The Reason why the Ayah of Li`an was revealed</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: \"When the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً</div><p>(And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever) 24:4 was revealed, Sa`d bin `Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, -- the leader of the Ansar -- said, `Is this how it was revealed, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْصَارِ أَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ مَا يَقُولُ سَيِّدُكُمْ؟»</div><p>(O Ansar, did you hear what your leader said) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, do not blame him, for he is a jealous man. By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin, and he never divorced a woman but none of us would dare to marry her because he is so jealous.' Sa`d said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I know that it (the Ayah) is true and is from Allah, but I am surprised. If I found some wicked man lying down with my wife, should I not disturb him until I have brought four witnesses By Allah, he would have finished what he was doing before I could bring them!' A little while later, Hilal bin Umayyah -- one of the three whose repentance had been accepted -- came back from his lands at night and found a man with his wife. He saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, but he did not disturb him until the morning. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I came to my wife at night and found a man with her, and I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.' The Messenger of Allah did not like what he had said and got very upset. The Ansar gathered around him and said, `We were being tested by what Sa`d bin Ubadah said, and now the Messenger of Allah will punish Hilal bin Umayyah and declare his testimony before people to be unacceptable.' Hilal said: `By Allah, I hope that Allah will make for me a way out from this problem.' Hilal said, `O Messenger of Allah, I see how upset you are by what I have said, but Allah knows that I am telling the truth.' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah wanted to have him flogged, but then Allah sent revelation to His Messenger . When the revelation came upon him, they knew about it from the change in his face, so they would leave him alone until the revelation was finished. Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَـدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَـدَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah...,) Then the revelation was finished and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْشِرْ يَا هِلَالُ فَقَدْ جَعَلَ اللهُ لَكَ فَرَجًا وَمَخْرَجًا»</div><p>(Rejoice, O Hilal, for Allah has made a way out for you.) Hilal said, `I had been hoping for this from my Lord, may He be glorified.' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرْسِلُوا إِلَيْهَا»</div><p>(Send for her.) So they sent for her and she came. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah to them both, and reminded them that the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe than the punishment in this world. Hilal said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I have spoken the truth about her.' She said, `He is lying.' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَاعِنُوا بَيْنَهُمَا»</div><p>(Make them both swear the Li`an.) So Hilal was told, `Testify.' So he testified four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth. When he came to the fifth testimony, he was told, `O Hilal, have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' He said, `By Allah, Allah will not punish me for it, just as He has not caused me to be flogged for it.' So he testified for the fifth time that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he was telling a lie. Then it was said to his wife, `Testify four times by Allah that he is telling a lie.' And when his wife reached the fifth testimony, she was told, `Have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' She hesitated for a while, and was about to admit her guilt, then she said: `By Allah, I will not expose my people to shame, and she swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth.' Then the Messenger of Allah separated them, and decreed that her child should not be attributed to any father, nor should the child be accused, and whoever accused her or her child, they would be subject to punishment. He also decreed that Hilal was not obliged to house her or feed her, because they had not been separated by divorce, nor had he died and left her a widow. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أُصَيْهِبَ (أُرَيْسِحَ) حَمْشَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِهِلَالٍ، وَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَوْرَقَ جَعَدًا جُمَالِيًّا خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِلَّذِي رُمِيَتْتِبهِ»</div><p>(If she gives birth to a red-haired child (with skinny thighs) and thin legs, then he is Hilal's child, but if she gives birth to a curly-haired child with thick legs and plump buttocks, then this is what she is accused of.) She subsequently gave birth to a child who was curly-haired with thick legs and plump buttocks, and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا الْأَيْمَانُ لَكَانَ لِي وَلَهَا شَأْنٌ»</div><p>(Were it not for the oath that she swore, I would deal with her.)\" `Ikrimah said, \"The child grew up to become the governor of Egypt, and he was given his mother's name and was not attributed to any father.\" Abu Dawud recorded a similar but briefer report. This Hadith has corroborating reports in the books of Sahih and elsewhere, with many chains of narration, including the report narrated by Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas, that Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife before the Prophet with Sharik bin Sahma'. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ أَوْحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence or the punishment on your back.) He said, \"O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us saw a man with his wife, how could he go and get evidence\" The Prophet again said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ وَإِلَّاحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence otherwise the punishment on your back.) Hilal said, \"By the One Who sent you with the truth! I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal something that will protect my back from the punishment. \" Then Jibril came down and brought the revelation,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) Then he recited until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) 24:6. When the revelation had finished, the Prophet sent for them both.

Will one of you repent) Then she stood up and gave her testimony, and when she reached the fifth oath, they stopped her and said, \"If you swear the fifth oath and you are lying, the curse of Allah will be inevitable.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"She hesitated and kept quiet until we thought that she had changed her mind, then she said, `I will not dishonor my people today', and she went ahead. Then the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْصِرُوهَا، فَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَكْحَلَ الْعَيْنَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِشَرِيكِ ابْنِ سَحْمَاءَ»</div><p>(Wait until she gives birth, and if she gives birth to a child whose eyes look as if they are ringed with kohl and who has plump buttocks and thick legs, then he is the child of Sharik bin Sahma'.)

This version was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, but the event has been narrated with additional chains of narration from Ibn `Abbas and others. Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: During the governorship of Ibn Az-Zubayr I was asked about the couple who engage in Li`an, and whether they should be separated, and I did not know the answer. I got up and went to the house of Ibn `Umar, and said, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman, should the couple who engage in Li`an be separated\" He said, \"Subhan Allah, the first one to ask about this was so-and-so the son of so-and-so. He said, `O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of a man who sees his wife committing an immoral sin If he speaks he will be speaking about something very serious, and if he keeps quiet he will be keeping quiet about something very serious.' The Prophet  kept quiet and did not answer him. Later on, he came to him and said, `What I asked you about is something with which I myself being tested with.' Then Allah revealed the Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.)

Then the Prophet turned to the woman and advised the woman and reminded her about Allah, and told her that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The woman said, `By the One Who sent you with the truth, he is lying.' So the Prophet  started with the man, who swore four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth, and swore the fifth oath that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he were lying.

      "text": "<h2>Details of Al-Li`an</h2><p>This Ayah offers a way out for husbands. If a husband has accused his wife but cannot come up with proof, he can swear the Li`an (the oath of condemnation) as Allah commanded. This means that he brings her before the Imam and states what he is accusing her of. The ruler then asks him to swear four times by Allah in front of four witnesses</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) in his accusation of her adultery.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie.) If he says that, then she is divorced from him by the very act of this Li`an; she is forever forbidden for him and he must give her Mahr to her. The punishment for Zina should be carried out on her, and nothing can prevent the punishment except if she also swears the oath of condemnation (Li`an) and swears by Allah four times that he is one of those who lied, i.e., in what he is accusing her of;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; should be that the crath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.)

And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) The wrath of Allah is mentioned specially in the case of the woman, because usually a man would not go to the extent of exposing his wife and accusing her of Zina unless he is telling the truth and has good reason to do this, and she knows that what he is accusing her of is true. So in her case the fifth testimony calls for the wrath of Allah to be upon her, for the one upon whom is the wrath of Allah, is the one who knows the truth yet deviates from it.

The ruler then asks him to swear four times by Allah in front of four witnesses</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) in his accusation of her adultery.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; the invoking of the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie.) If he says that, then she is divorced from him by the very act of this Li`an; she is forever forbidden for him and he must give her Mahr to her. The punishment for Zina should be carried out on her, and nothing can prevent the punishment except if she also swears the oath of condemnation (Li`an) and swears by Allah four times that he is one of those who lied, i.e., in what he is accusing her of;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And the fifth; should be that the crath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ</div><p>(But she shall avert the punishment) meaning, the prescribed punishment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا الْعَذَابَ أَن تَشْهَدَ أَرْبَعَ شَهَادَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ - وَالْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ </div><p>(if she bears witness four times by Allah, that he is telling a lie. And the fifth; should be that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) The wrath of Allah is mentioned specially in the case of the woman, because usually a man would not go to the extent of exposing his wife and accusing her of Zina unless he is telling the truth and has good reason to do this, and she knows that what he is accusing her of is true. So in her case the fifth testimony calls for the wrath of Allah to be upon her, for the one upon whom is the wrath of Allah, is the one who knows the truth yet deviates from it. Then Allah mentions His grace and kindness to His creation in that He has prescribed for them a way out of their difficulties. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ</div><p>(And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you!) meaning, many of your affairs would have been too difficult for you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ</div><p>(And that Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance,) means, from His servants, even if that comes after they have sworn a confirmed oath.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(the All-Wise. ) in what He prescribes and commands and forbids. There are Hadiths which explain how we are to put this Ayah into effect, why it was revealed and concerning whom among the Companions it was revealed.</p><h2>The Reason why the Ayah of Li`an was revealed</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: \"When the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَاجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً</div><p>(And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever) 24:4 was revealed, Sa`d bin `Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him, -- the leader of the Ansar -- said, `Is this how it was revealed, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْصَارِ أَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ مَا يَقُولُ سَيِّدُكُمْ؟»</div><p>(O Ansar, did you hear what your leader said) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, do not blame him, for he is a jealous man. By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin, and he never divorced a woman but none of us would dare to marry her because he is so jealous.' Sa`d said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I know that it (the Ayah) is true and is from Allah, but I am surprised. If I found some wicked man lying down with my wife, should I not disturb him until I have brought four witnesses By Allah, he would have finished what he was doing before I could bring them!' A little while later, Hilal bin Umayyah -- one of the three whose repentance had been accepted -- came back from his lands at night and found a man with his wife. He saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, but he did not disturb him until the morning. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I came to my wife at night and found a man with her, and I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.' The Messenger of Allah did not like what he had said and got very upset. The Ansar gathered around him and said, `We were being tested by what Sa`d bin Ubadah said, and now the Messenger of Allah will punish Hilal bin Umayyah and declare his testimony before people to be unacceptable.' Hilal said: `By Allah, I hope that Allah will make for me a way out from this problem.' Hilal said, `O Messenger of Allah, I see how upset you are by what I have said, but Allah knows that I am telling the truth.' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah wanted to have him flogged, but then Allah sent revelation to His Messenger . When the revelation came upon him, they knew about it from the change in his face, so they would leave him alone until the revelation was finished. Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَـدَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَـدَاتٍ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies by Allah...,) Then the revelation was finished and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْشِرْ يَا هِلَالُ فَقَدْ جَعَلَ اللهُ لَكَ فَرَجًا وَمَخْرَجًا»</div><p>(Rejoice, O Hilal, for Allah has made a way out for you.) Hilal said, `I had been hoping for this from my Lord, may He be glorified.' The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرْسِلُوا إِلَيْهَا»</div><p>(Send for her.) So they sent for her and she came. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah to them both, and reminded them that the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe than the punishment in this world. Hilal said, `By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I have spoken the truth about her.' She said, `He is lying.' The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَاعِنُوا بَيْنَهُمَا»</div><p>(Make them both swear the Li`an.) So Hilal was told, `Testify.' So he testified four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth. When he came to the fifth testimony, he was told, `O Hilal, have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' He said, `By Allah, Allah will not punish me for it, just as He has not caused me to be flogged for it.' So he testified for the fifth time that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he was telling a lie. Then it was said to his wife, `Testify four times by Allah that he is telling a lie.' And when his wife reached the fifth testimony, she was told, `Have Taqwa of Allah, for the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter, and this will mean that the punishment will be inevitable for you.' She hesitated for a while, and was about to admit her guilt, then she said: `By Allah, I will not expose my people to shame, and she swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth.' Then the Messenger of Allah separated them, and decreed that her child should not be attributed to any father, nor should the child be accused, and whoever accused her or her child, they would be subject to punishment. He also decreed that Hilal was not obliged to house her or feed her, because they had not been separated by divorce, nor had he died and left her a widow. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أُصَيْهِبَ (أُرَيْسِحَ) حَمْشَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِهِلَالٍ، وَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَوْرَقَ جَعَدًا جُمَالِيًّا خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِلَّذِي رُمِيَتْتِبهِ»</div><p>(If she gives birth to a red-haired child (with skinny thighs) and thin legs, then he is Hilal's child, but if she gives birth to a curly-haired child with thick legs and plump buttocks, then this is what she is accused of.) She subsequently gave birth to a child who was curly-haired with thick legs and plump buttocks, and the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا الْأَيْمَانُ لَكَانَ لِي وَلَهَا شَأْنٌ»</div><p>(Were it not for the oath that she swore, I would deal with her.)\" `Ikrimah said, \"The child grew up to become the governor of Egypt, and he was given his mother's name and was not attributed to any father.\" Abu Dawud recorded a similar but briefer report. This Hadith has corroborating reports in the books of Sahih and elsewhere, with many chains of narration, including the report narrated by Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas, that Hilal bin Umayyah accused his wife before the Prophet with Sharik bin Sahma'. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ أَوْحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence or the punishment on your back.) He said, \"O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us saw a man with his wife, how could he go and get evidence\" The Prophet again said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْبَيِّنَةَ وَإِلَّاحَدٌّ فِي ظَهْرِكَ»</div><p>(Evidence otherwise the punishment on your back.) Hilal said, \"By the One Who sent you with the truth! I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal something that will protect my back from the punishment. \" Then Jibril came down and brought the revelation,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) Then he recited until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(that he is one of those who speak the truth) 24:6. When the revelation had finished, the Prophet sent for them both. Hilal came and gave his testimony, and the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمَا كَاذِبٌ، فَهَلْ مِنْكُمَا تَائِبٌ؟»</div><p>(Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent) Then she stood up and gave her testimony, and when she reached the fifth oath, they stopped her and said, \"If you swear the fifth oath and you are lying, the curse of Allah will be inevitable.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"She hesitated and kept quiet until we thought that she had changed her mind, then she said, `I will not dishonor my people today', and she went ahead. Then the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْصِرُوهَا، فَإِنْ جَاءَتْ بِهِ أَكْحَلَ الْعَيْنَيْنِ سَابِغَ الْأَلْيَتَيْنِ خَدَلَّجَ السَّاقَيْنِ، فَهُوَ لِشَرِيكِ ابْنِ سَحْمَاءَ»</div><p>(Wait until she gives birth, and if she gives birth to a child whose eyes look as if they are ringed with kohl and who has plump buttocks and thick legs, then he is the child of Sharik bin Sahma'.) She gave birth to a child who matched this description, and the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا مَا مَضَى مِنْ كِتَابِ اللهِ لَكَانَ لِي وَ لَهَا شَأْنٌ»</div><p>(Were it not for the Book of Allah, I would deal with her.) This version was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, but the event has been narrated with additional chains of narration from Ibn `Abbas and others. Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: During the governorship of Ibn Az-Zubayr I was asked about the couple who engage in Li`an, and whether they should be separated, and I did not know the answer. I got up and went to the house of Ibn `Umar, and said, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman, should the couple who engage in Li`an be separated\" He said, \"Subhan Allah, the first one to ask about this was so-and-so the son of so-and-so. He said, `O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of a man who sees his wife committing an immoral sin If he speaks he will be speaking about something very serious, and if he keeps quiet he will be keeping quiet about something very serious.' The Prophet  kept quiet and did not answer him. Later on, he came to him and said, `What I asked you about is something with which I myself being tested with.' Then Allah revealed the Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَجَهُمْ</div><p>(And for those who accuse their wives,) until he reached:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَّ غَضَبَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(That the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaks the truth.) He started to advise the man and remind him about Allah, and told him that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The man said: `By the One Who sent you with the truth, I was not telling you a lie.' Then the Prophet turned to the woman and advised the woman and reminded her about Allah, and told her that the punishment of this world is easier than the punishment of the Hereafter. The woman said, `By the One Who sent you with the truth, he is lying.' So the Prophet  started with the man, who swore four times by Allah that he was one of those who speak the truth, and swore the fifth oath that the curse of Allah would be upon him if he were lying. Then he turned to the woman, who swore four times by Allah that he was lying, and swore the fifth oath that the wrath of Allah would be upon her if he was telling the truth. Then he separated them.\" It was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Two Sahihs.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>Al-Ifk (the Slander)</h2><p>The next ten Ayat were all revealed concerning `A'ishah, the mother of the believers, may Allah be pleased with her, when the people of slander and falsehood among the hypocrites made their accusations against her and spread lies about her. Allah became jealous on her behalf and on behalf of His Prophet , and revealed her innocence to protect the honor of the Messenger of Allah . He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَآءُوا بِالإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(Verily, those who brought forth the slander are a group among you.) meaning they were not one or two, but a group. Foremost among this group was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, the leader of the hypocrites, who fabricated the lie and whispered it to others, until some of the Muslims started to believe it, and others thought it might be possible and began to talk about it. This is how matters remained for almost a month, until Qur'an was revealed. This is reported in Sahih Hadiths. Imam Ahmad recorded that Az-Zuhri said: Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Alqamah bin Waqqas and `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud told me about the story of `A'ishah, the wife of the Prophet , when the people of the slander said what they said about her, and Allah declared her innocence. Each of them told something about the story, and some of them knew more details than others or had memorized more than others. I learned the story from each of them, who had heard it from `A'ishah herself, and what one told me confirmed what the others said. They mentioned that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the Prophet , said: \"When the Messenger of Allah wanted to go on a journey, he would cast lots among his wives, and the one whose lot was drawn would go with him.\" `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"So he drew lots among us with regard to a campaign he was going out on, and mine was drawn, so I went out with the Messenger of Allah . This was after the commandment of Hijab had been revealed, so I traveled in my howdah and stayed in it when we camped. We traveled until the Messenger of Allah completed his campaign, then we returned. As we were approaching Al-Madinah, we paused for a while, then they announced that the journey was to be resumed. When I heard this, I walked quickly away from the army to answer the call of nature, then I came back to my howdah. Then I put my hand to my chest and noticed that a necklace of mine that was made of onyx and cornelian had broken, so I went back and looked for it, and was delayed because of that. In the meantime, the people who used to lift my howdah onto my camel came along and put it on the camel, thinking that I was inside. In those times women were more slender and not so heavy, they only ate mouthfuls of food. So the people did not think anything of the howdah being so light when they lifted it up, as I was a young woman. They set off, and I found my necklace after the army had moved on. Then I came back to the place where we had stopped, and I saw no one to call or answer. So I went to the place where I had been, thinking that the people would miss me and come back for me. While I was sitting there, I fell asleep. tSafwan bin Al-Mu`attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani had rested during the night behind the army. Then he set out just before daybreak and reached the place where I was in the morning, where he saw the outline of a person sleeping. He came to me and recognized me when he saw me, as he had seen me before Hijab was made obligatory for me. When he saw me and said `Truly, to Allah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return,' I woke up, and covered my face with my Jilbab (outer garment). By Allah, he did not speak a word to me and I did not hear him say anything except `Truly, to Allah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return,' until he brought his camel and made it kneel so that I could ride upon it, then he set out leading the camel until we caught up with the army at Zuhr time.</p><p>There are people who are doomed because of what happened to me, and the one who had the greater share therein was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. When we came back to Al-Madinah, I was ill for a month, and the people were talking about what the people of the slander were saying, and I knew nothing about it. What upset me when I was ill was that I did not see the kindness I used to see on the part of the Messenger of Allah . When I was ill; he would just come in and say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ تِيكُمْ؟»</div><p>(How is that (lady)) That is what upset me. I did not feel that there was anything wrong until I went out after I felt better, and Umm Mistah went out with me, walking towards Al-Manasi`, which is where we used to go to relieve ourselves, and we would not go out for that purpose except at night. This was before we had lavatories close to our houses; our habit was similar to that of the early Arabs in that we went out into the deserts to relieve ourselves, because we considered it troublesome and harmful to have lavatories in our houses. So I went out with Umm Mistah, who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin `Amir, the paternal aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. Her son was Mistah bin Uthathah bin `Abbad bin Al-Muttalib. When we finished what we had to do, the daughter of Abu Ruhm Umm Mistah and I came back towards my house. Umm Mistah stumbled over her apron and said, `May Mistah be ruined!' I said to her, `What a bad thing you have said! Are you abusing a man who was present at Badr' She said, `Good grief, have you not heard what he said' I said, `What did he say' So she told me what the people of the slander were saying, which made me even more ill. When I returned home, the Messenger of Allah came in to me and greeted me, then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ تِيكُمْ؟»</div><p>(How is that (lady)) I said to him, `Will you give me permission to go to my parents' At that time I wanted to confirm the news by hearing it from them. The Messenger of Allah gave me permission, so I went to my parents and asked my mother, `O my mother, what are the people talking about' My mother said, `Calm down, for by Allah, there is no beautiful woman who is loved by her husband and has co-wives but those co-wives would find fault with her.' I said, `Subhan Allah! Are the people really talking about that' I wept throughout the whole night until morning. My tears never ceased and I did not sleep at all, and morning came while I was still weeping. Because the revelation had ceased, the Messenger of Allah called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usamah bin Zayd, and consulted with them about divorcing his wife. As for Usamah bin Zayd, he told the Messenger of Allah about what he knew of his wife's innocence and his fondness for her. He said, `O Messenger of Allah, she is your wife, and we do not know anything about her but good.' But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, `O Messenger of Allah, Allah has not imposed restrictions on you, and there are plenty of other women besides her. If you ask her servant girl, she will tell you the truth.' So the Messenger of Allah called Barirah and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيْ بَرِيرَةُ هَلْ رَأَيْتِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ يَرِيبُكِ مِنْ عَائِشَةَ؟»</div><p>(O Barirah, have you ever seen anything that might make you suspicious about `A'ishah) Barirah said to him, `By the One Who sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything for which I could blame her, apart from the fact that she is a young girl who sometimes falls asleep and leaves her family's dough unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' So then the Messenger of Allah got up and (addressed the people) and asked who could sort out `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul for him. While he was standing on the Minbar, the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَامَعْشَرَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مَنْ يَعْذِرُنِي مِنْ رَجُلٍ قَدْ بَلَغَنِي أَذَاهُ فِي أَهْلِ بَيْتِي، فَوَاللهِ مَا عَلِمْتُ عَلَى أَهْلِي إِلَّا خَيْرًا، وَلَقَدْ ذَكَرُوا رَجُلًا مَا عَلِمْتُ عَلَيْهِ إِلَّا خَيْرًا، وَمَا كَانَ يَدْخُلُ عَلَى أَهْلِي إِلَّا مَعِي»</div><p>(O Muslims, who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and the people are blaming a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he has never entered upon my family except with me.) Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari stood up and said, `O Messenger of Allah, by Allah I will deal with him for you. If he is from (the tribe of) Al-Aws, then I will cut off his head, and if he is from our brothers of (the tribe of) Al-Khazraj, tell us what to do and we will do it.' Then Sa`d bin `Ubadah stood up. He was the leader of Al-Khazraj, and he was a righteous man, but he was overwhelmed with tribal chauvinism. He said to Sa`d bin Mu`adh, `By Allah, you will not kill him and you will never be able to kill him.' Then Usayd bin Hudayr, who was the cousin of Sa`d bin Mu`adh, stood up and said to Sa`d bin `Ubadah, `You are lying! By Allah, we will kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on behalf of the hypocrites!' Then the two groups, Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, started to get angry and were about to come to blows, with the Messenger of Allah standing there on the Minbar, trying to calm them down until they became quiet, then the Messenger of Allah also fell silent. On that day I kept on weeping so much, my tears never ceased and I did not sleep at all. My parents thought that my liver would burst from all that weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, a woman of the Ansar asked for permission to see me. I let her in, and she sat and wept with me. While we were in that state, the Messenger of Allah came in, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since the rumors began, and a month had passed by without any revelation coming to him concerning my case. The Messenger of Allah recited the Tashahhud when he sat down, then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَّا بَعْدُ، يَا عَائِشَةُ فَإِنَّهُ قَدْ بَلَغَنِي عَنْكِ كَذَا وَكَذَا،فَإِنْ كُنْتِ بَرِيئَةً فَسَيُبَرِّئُكِ اللهُ، وَإِنْ كُنْتِ أَلْمَمْتِ بِذَنْبٍ فَاسْتَغْفِرِي اللهَ ثُمَّ تُوبِي إِلَيْهِ، فَإِنَّ الْعَبْدَ إِذَا اعْتَرَفَ بِذَنْبِهِ ثُمَّ تَابَ، تَابَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ»</div><p>(Thereafter, O `A'ishah, I have been told such and such a thing about you, and if you are innocent, then Allah will reveal your innocence, but if you have committed a sin, then seek Allah's forgiveness and turn in repentance to Him, for when a servant confesses his sin and repents to Allah, He accepts his repentance.) When the Messenger of Allah finished what he had to say, my tears stopped completely and I not longer felt even one drop. Then I said to my father, `Answer the Messenger of Allah on my behalf.' He said, `I do not know what I should say to the Messenger of Allah.' So I said to my mother, `Answer the Messenger of Allah on my behalf.' She said, `I do not know what I should say to the Messenger of Allah.' So even though I was just a young girl who had not memorized much of the Qur'an, I said: `By Allah, I know that you have heard so much of this story that it has become planted in your minds and you believe it. So now if I tell you that I am innocent -- and Allah knows that I am innocent -- you will not believe me; but if I admit something to you -- and Allah knows that I am innocent -- you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find any example to give you except for that which the Prophet Yusuf's father said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ وَاللَّهُ الْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَى مَا تَصِفُونَ</div><p>(So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allah Whose help can be sought against that (lie) which you describe) 12:18. Then I turned my face away and lay down on my bed. By Allah, at that point I knew I was innocent and that Allah would prove my innocence because I was innocent, but by Allah, I did not think that Allah would reveal Qur'an that would be forever recited concerning my situation, because I thought of myself as too insignificant for Allah to reveal anything concerning me. But I hoped that the Messenger of Allah would see a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah did not move from where he was sitting and no one left the house before Allah sent down revelation to His Prophet , and he was overtaken by the state that always overtook him when the revelation came upon him, until drops of sweat like pearls would run down him, even on a winter's day; this was because of the heaviness of the words which were being revealed to him. When that state passed -- and the Messenger of Allah was smiling -- the first thing he said was,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَبْشِرِي يَا عَائِشَةُ، أَمَّا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَقَدْ بَرَّأَكِ»</div><p>(Be glad O `A'ishah, Allah has declared your innocence.) My mother said to me, `Get up and go to him.' I said, `By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not give praise to anyone except Allah, may He be glorified, for He is the One Who has proven my innocence.' So Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَآءُوا بِالإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(Verily, those who brought forth the slander are a group among you.), until the ten Ayat. Allah revealed these Ayat concerning my innocence. Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, who used to spend on Mistah bin Uthathah because he was a close relative and because he was poor, said, `By Allah, I will never spend anything on him again after what he has said about `A'ishah. ' Then Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَأْتَلِ أُوْلُواْ الْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَالسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُواْ أُوْلِى الْقُرْبَى</div><p>(And let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth swear not to give to their kinsmen.) until His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَ تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Do you not love that Allah should forgive you And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) 24:22. So Abu Bakr said, `By Allah, certainly I love that Allah should forgive me.' So he resumed spending on Mistah as he had spent on him before, and he said, `By Allah, I shall never stop spending on him.' The Messenger of Allah asked Zaynab bint Jahsh about my situation, and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا زَيْنَبُ مَاذَا عَلِمْتِ أَوْ رَأَيْتِ؟»</div><p>(O Zaynab, what do you know and what have you seen) She said, `O Messenger of Allah, may Allah protect my hearing and my sight. By Allah, I know nothing but good.' She is the one who used to compete with me among the wives of the Prophet , but Allah protected her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister Hamnah bint Jahsh kept on fighting on her behalf, so she was doomed along with those who were doomed.\" Ibn Shihab said, \"This is as much as we know about this group of people.\" It was also by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs from the Hadith of Az-Zuhri, and by Ibn Ishaq also from Az-Zuhri. He also said: \"Yahya bin `Abbad bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr told me from his father, from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and `Abdullah bin Abi Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr bin Hazm Al-Ansari told me from `Amrah, from `A'ishah, (a report) similar to that quoted above. And Allah knows best. Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَآءُوا بِالإِفْكِ</div><p>(Verily, those who brought forth the slander) means, the lies, falsehood and fabrications.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُصْبَةٌ</div><p>(are a group) means, a gang among you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرّاً لَّكُمْ</div><p>(Consider it not a bad thing for you.) O family of Abu Bakr,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(Nay, it is good for you.) means, in this world and the Hereafter, honorable mention in this world and raised status in the Hereafter. Allah demonstrated the esteem with which He regarded the family of Abu Bakr when He defended `A'ishah the Mother of the believers, may Allah be pleased with her, by revealing her innocence in the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ</div><p>(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it. ..) 41:42. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, entered upon her when she was dying, he said to her, \"Rejoice, for you are the wife of the Messenger of Allah and he used to love you; he did not marry any virgin other than you, and your innocence was revealed from heaven.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّا اكْتَسَبَ مِنَ الإِثْمِ</div><p>(Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin,) means, each of those who spoke about this matter and accused the Mother of the believers `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of any immoral action, will have a great share of punishment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى تَوَلَّى كِبْرَهُ مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(and as for him among them who had the greater share therein,) It was said that this referred to the one who initiated the rumors, or that it was the one who collected rumors and spread them among the people.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(his will be a great torment.) means, for that. He was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, may Allah disfigure him and curse him.</p>"

Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(if you are believers.) meaning, if you believe in Allah and His Laws, and you respect His Messenger . As for those who are described as disbelievers, a different ruling applies in their case. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الاٌّيَـتِ</div><p>(And Allah makes the Ayat plain to you,) meaning, He makes clear to you the rulings of Shari`ah and His divine decrees.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) means, He knows what is right for His servants and He is Wise in His Laws and decrees.</p>"

This Ayah was revealed concerning As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, when he swore that he would not help Mistah bin Uthathah after he said what he said about `A'ishah, as we have already seen in the Hadith. When Allah revealed the innocence of the Mother of the believers, `A'ishah, and the believers were happy and content with the outcome of this incident, and those believers who had talked about the matter repented, and the prescribed punishment had been carried out upon those on whom it was carried out, then Allah started to soften the heart of As-Siddiq towards his relative Mistah bin Uthathah. Mistah was the cousin of As-Siddiq, the son of his maternal aunt, and he was a poor man with no wealth except whatever Abu Bakr spent on him. He was one of those who had migrated for the sake of Allah. He had invented the lies and the slander, but then Allah accepted his repentance from that and the prescribed punishment was carried out on him. As-Siddiq was known for his generosity and he did favors to his relatives and strangers alike. When this Ayah was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَ تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ</div><p>(Do you not love that Allah should forgive you), which shows that the reward fits the action, and that `if you forgive others, you will be forgiven,' then As-Siddiq said, \"Of course, by Allah, we love -- O our Lord -- that You should forgive us.\" Then he resumed his spending on Mistah and said, \"By Allah I will never stop spending on him.\" This was to counteract what he had said previously, \"By Allah I will never spend on him.\" This proves that he deserved to be called As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him and his daughter.</p>"

He interpreted it to mean that evil speech is more suited to evil people, and good speech is more suited to good people. What the hypocrites attributed to `A'ishah was more suited to them, and she was most suited to innocence and having nothing to do with them.

Allah taught these manners (of seeking permission) to His believing servants and commanded them not to enter houses other than their own until they had asked permission, i.e., to ask for permission before entering and to give the greeting of Salam after asking. One should seek permission three times, and if permission is given, (he may enter), otherwise he should go away.It was reported in the Sahih that when Abu Musa asked `Umar three times for permission to enter and he did not give him permission, he went away. Then `Umar said, \"Did I not hear the voice of `Abdullah bin Qays asking for permission to enter Let him come in.\" So they looked for him, but found that he had gone.

They said, \"No one will give testimony for you but the youngest of us.\" So Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri went with him and told `Umar about that. `Umar said, \"What kept me from learning that was my being busy in the marketplace.\" Imam Ahmad recorded a narration stating that Anas or someone else said that the Messenger of Allah asked for permission to enter upon Sa`d bin `Ubadah. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ»</div><p>(As-Salamu `Alayka wa Rahmatullah) Sa`d said, \"Wa `Alaykas-Salam Wa Rahmatullah,\" but the Prophet did not hear the returned greeting until he had given the greeting three times and Sa`d had returned the greeting three times, but he did not let him hear him i.e., Sa`d responded in a low voice. So the Prophet went back, and Sa`d followed him and said,\"O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransomed for you! You did not give any greeting but I responded to you, but I did not let you hear me. I wanted to get more of your Salams and blessings.\" Then he admitted him to his house and offered him some raisins.

Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas, \"Putting people at ease means seeking permission to enter.\" This was also the view of others. Imam Ahmad recorded from Kaladah bin Al-Hanbal that at the time of the Conquest (of Makkah), Safwan bin Umayyah sent him with milk, a small gazelle, and small cucumbers when the Prophet was at the top of the valley. He said, \"I entered upon the Prophet and I did not give the greeting of Salam nor ask for permission to enter.

At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Ibn Jurayj said that he heard `Ata' bin Abi Rabah narrating that Ibn `Abbas, may Alah be pleased with him, said, \"There are three Ayat whose rulings people neglect.

As for seeking permission, the people have forgotten all about it.\" I said, \"Should I seek permission to enter upon my orphan sisters who are living with me in one house\" He said, \"Yes.\" I asked him to make allowances for me but he refused and said, \"Do you want to see them naked\" I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Then ask for permission to enter.\" I asked him again and he said, \"Do you want to obey Allah\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then ask for permission.\" Ibn Jurayj said, \"Ibn Tawus told me that his father said, `There are no women whom I hate to see naked more than those who are my Mahrams.'

This was the greeting among the people at that time. They did not seek permission to enter one another's houses; a man might walk straight in and say, \"I have come in,\" and so on. This was difficult for a man to bear, as he might be with his wife. So Allah changed all that by enjoining covering and chastity, making it pure and free of any sin or impropriety. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّى تَسْتَأْنِسُواْ وَتُسَلِّمُواْ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا</div><p>(O you who believe!

Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(that is better for you,) meaning, seeking permission to enter in is better for you because it is better for both parties, the one who is seeking permission to enter and the people inside the house.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may remember.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فِيهَآ أَحَداً فَلاَ تَدْخُلُوهَا حَتَّى يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمُ</div><p>(And if you find no one therein, still enter not until permission has been given.)

Ibn Jurayj said, \"Ibn `Abbas said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ</div><p>(Enter not houses other than your own, ) then this was abrogated and an exception was made, and Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ فِيهَا مَتَاعٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(There is no sin on you that you enter houses uninhabited, (when) you have any interest in them.)

This was difficult for a man to bear, as he might be with his wife. So Allah changed all that by enjoining covering and chastity, making it pure and free of any sin or impropriety. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّى تَسْتَأْنِسُواْ وَتُسَلِّمُواْ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا</div><p>(O you who believe!

      "text": "<h2>Seeking Permission and the Etiquette of entering Houses</h2><p>This is the Islamic etiquette. Allah taught these manners (of seeking permission) to His believing servants and commanded them not to enter houses other than their own until they had asked permission, i.e., to ask for permission before entering and to give the greeting of Salam after asking. One should seek permission three times, and if permission is given, (he may enter), otherwise he should go away.It was reported in the Sahih that when Abu Musa asked `Umar three times for permission to enter and he did not give him permission, he went away. Then `Umar said, \"Did I not hear the voice of `Abdullah bin Qays asking for permission to enter Let him come in.\" So they looked for him, but found that he had gone. When he came later on, `Umar said, \"Why did you go away\" He said, \"I asked for permission to enter three times, but permission was not given to me, and I heard the Prophet say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا اسْتَأْذَنَ أَحَدُكُمْ ثَلَاثًا فَلَمْ يُؤْذَنْ لَهُ فَلْيَنْصَرِفْ»</div><p>(If any one of you asks for permission three times and it is not given, then let him go away.)\" `Umar said, \"You should certainly bring me evidence for this or I shall beat you!\" So he went to a group of the Ansar and told them what `Umar said. They said, \"No one will give testimony for you but the youngest of us.\" So Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri went with him and told `Umar about that. `Umar said, \"What kept me from learning that was my being busy in the marketplace.\" Imam Ahmad recorded a narration stating that Anas or someone else said that the Messenger of Allah asked for permission to enter upon Sa`d bin `Ubadah. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ»</div><p>(As-Salamu `Alayka wa Rahmatullah) Sa`d said, \"Wa `Alaykas-Salam Wa Rahmatullah,\" but the Prophet did not hear the returned greeting until he had given the greeting three times and Sa`d had returned the greeting three times, but he did not let him hear him i.e., Sa`d responded in a low voice. So the Prophet went back, and Sa`d followed him and said,\"O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransomed for you! You did not give any greeting but I responded to you, but I did not let you hear me. I wanted to get more of your Salams and blessings.\" Then he admitted him to his house and offered him some raisins. The Prophet ate, and when he finished, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَكَلَ طَعَامَكُمُ الْأَبْرَارُ، وَصَلَّتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ، وَأَفْطَرَ عِنْدَكُمُ الصَّائِمُونَ»</div><p>(May the righteous eat your food, may the angels send blessings upon you and may those who are fasting break their fast with you.) It should also be known that the one who is seeking permission to enter should not stand directly in front of the door; he should have the door on his right or left, because of the Hadith recorded by Abu Dawud from `Abdullah bin Busr, who said, \"When the Messenger of Allah came to someone's door, he would never stand directly in front of it, but to the right or left, and he would say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ»</div><p>(As-Salamu `Alaykum, As-Salamu `Alaykum.) That was because at that time the houses had no covers or curtains over their doorways.\" This report was recorded by Abu Dawud only. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ امْرَءًا اطَّلَعَ عَلَيْكَ بِغَيْرِ إِذْنٍ فَخَذَفْتَهُ بِحَصَاةٍ فَفَقَأْتَ عَيْنَهُ، مَا كَانَ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ جُنَاحٍ»</div><p>(If a person looks into your house without your permission, and you throw a stone at him and it puts his eye out, there will be no blame on you.) The Group recorded that Jabir said, \"I came to the Prophet with something that was owed by my father and knocked at the door. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ ذَا؟»</div><p>(Who is that) I said, \"I am!\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنَا أَنَا»</div><p>(I I) as if he disliked it.\" He did not like it because this word tells you nothing about who is saying it, unless he clearly states his name or the name by which he is known, (nickname) otherwise everyone could call himself \"Me\", and it does not fulfill the purpose of asking permission to enter, which is to put people at their ease, as commanded in the Ayah. Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas, \"Putting people at ease means seeking permission to enter.\" This was also the view of others. Imam Ahmad recorded from Kaladah bin Al-Hanbal that at the time of the Conquest (of Makkah), Safwan bin Umayyah sent him with milk, a small gazelle, and small cucumbers when the Prophet was at the top of the valley. He said, \"I entered upon the Prophet and I did not give the greeting of Salam nor ask for permission to enter. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ارْجِعْ فَقُلْ: السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَأَدْخُلُ؟»</div><p>(Go back and say: \"As-Salamu `Alaykum, may I enter\") This was after Safwan had become Muslim.\" This was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Ibn Jurayj said that he heard `Ata' bin Abi Rabah narrating that Ibn `Abbas, may Alah be pleased with him, said, \"There are three Ayat whose rulings people neglect. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عَندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَـكُمْ</div><p>(Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is the one who has the most Taqwa) 49:13, But (now) they say that the most honorable of them with Allah is the one who has the biggest house. As for seeking permission, the people have forgotten all about it.\" I said, \"Should I seek permission to enter upon my orphan sisters who are living with me in one house\" He said, \"Yes.\" I asked him to make allowances for me but he refused and said, \"Do you want to see them naked\" I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Then ask for permission to enter.\" I asked him again and he said, \"Do you want to obey Allah\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then ask for permission.\" Ibn Jurayj said, \"Ibn Tawus told me that his father said, `There are no women whom I hate to see naked more than those who are my Mahrams.' He was very strict on this point.\" Ibn Jurayj narrated that Az-Zuhri said, \"I heard Huzayl bin Shurahbil Al-Awdi Al-A`ma (say that) he heard Ibn Mas`ud say, `You have to seek permission to enter upon your mothers.\"' Ibn Jurayj said, \"I said to `Ata': `Does a man have to seek permission to enter upon his wife' He said, `No, it can be understood that this is not obligatory, but it is better for him to let her know that he is coming in so as not to startle her, because she may be in a state where she does not want him to see her. \"' Abu Ja`far bin Jarir narrated from the nephew of Zaynab -- the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud -- that Zaynab, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"When `Abdullah came back from some errand and reached the door, he would clear his throat and spit, because he did not want to come suddenly and find us in a state he disliked.\" Its chain of narration is Sahih.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّى تَسْتَأْنِسُواْ وَتُسَلِّمُواْ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا</div><p>(O you who believe!

      "text": "<h2>The Rulings of Hijab</h2><p>This is a command from Allah to the believing women, and jealousy on His part over the wives of His believing servants. It is also to distinguish the believing women from the women of the Jahiliyyah and the deeds of the pagan women. The reason for the revelation of this Ayah was mentioned by Muqatil bin Hayyan, when he said: \"We heard -- and Allah knows best -- that Jabir bin `Abdullah Al-Ansari narrated that Asma' bint Murshidah was in a house of hers in Bani Harithah, and the women started coming in to her without lower garments so that the anklets on their feet could be seen, along with their chests and forelocks. Asma' said: `How ugly this is!' Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـرِهِنَّ</div><p>(And tell the believing women to lower their gaze...)\" And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـرِهِنَّ</div><p>(And tell the believing women to lower their gaze) meaning, from that which Allah has forbidden them to look at, apart from their husbands. Some scholars said that it is permissible for women to look at non-Mahram men without desire, as it was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah was watching the Ethiopians playing with spears in the Masjid on the day of `Id, and `A'ishah the Mother of the believers was watching them from behind him and he was concealing her from them, until she got bored and went away.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ</div><p>(and protect their private parts). Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"From immoral actions.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah said: \"Every Ayah of the Qur'an in which protecting the private parts is mentioned means protecting them from Zina, except for this Ayah --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ</div><p>(and protect their private parts), which means protecting them from being seen by anybody.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا</div><p>(and not to show off their adornment except that which is apparent,) means, they should not show anything of their adornment to non-Mahram men except for whatever it is impossible to hide. Ibn Mas`ud said: \"Such as clothes and outer garments,\" Meaning what the Arab women used to wear of the veil which covered their clothes and whatever showed from underneath the outer garment. There is no blame on her for this, because this is something that she cannot conceal. Similar to that is what appears of her lower garment and what she cannot conceal. Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Abu Al-Jawza', Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and others also had the same view as Ibn Mas`ud.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ</div><p>(and to draw their veils all over their Juyub) means that they should wear the outer garment in such a way as to cover their chests and ribs, so that they will be different from the women of the Jahiliyyah, who did not do that but would pass in front of men with their chests completely uncovered, and with their necks, forelocks, hair and earrings uncovered. So Allah commanded the believing women to cover themselves, as He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ قُل لاًّزْوَجِكَ وَبَنَـتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَـبِيبِهِنَّ ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ</div><p>(O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies. That will be better, that they should be known, so as not to be annoyed) 33:59 And in this noble Ayah He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ</div><p>(and to draw their (Khumur) veils all over their Juyub) Khumur (veils) is the plural of Khimar, which means something that covers, and is what is used to cover the head. This is what is known among the people as a veil. Sa`id bin Jubayr said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ</div><p>(and to draw) means to pull it around and tie it securely.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ</div><p>(their veils all over their Juyub) means, over their necks and chests so that nothing can be seen of them. Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"May Allah have mercy on the women of the early emigrants. When Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ</div><p>(and to draw their veils all over their Juyub), they tore their aprons and Akhtamar themselves with them.\" He also narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, used to say: \"When this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَى جُيُوبِهِنَّ</div><p>(and to draw their veils all over their Juyub) was revealed, they took their Izars (waistsheets) and tore them at the edges, and Akhtamar themselves with them.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى أَخَوَتِهِنَّ</div><p>(and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers, or their sons, or their husband's sons, or their brothers or their brother's sons, or their sister's sons,) All of these are a woman's close relatives whom she can never marry (Mahram) and it is permissible for her to show her adornments to them, but without making a wanton display of herself. Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded that `Ikrimah commented on this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ</div><p>(and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers...), \"The paternal uncle and maternal uncle are not mentioned here, because they may describe a woman to their sons, so a woman should not remove her Khimar in front of her paternal or maternal uncle.\"With regard to the husband, all of this is for his sake, so she should try her best when adorning herself for him, unlike the way she should appear in front of others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نِسَآئِهِنَّ</div><p>(or their women,) this means that she may also wear her adornment in front of other Muslim women, but not in front of the women of Ahl Adh-Dhimmah (Jewish and Christian women), lest they describe her to their husbands. This is prohibited for all women, but more so in the case of the women of Ahl Adh-Dhimmah, because there is nothing to prevent them from doing that, but Muslim women know that it is unlawful and so, would be deterred from doing it. The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُبَاشِرِ الْمَرْأَةُ الْمَرْأَةَ فَتَنْعَتَهَا لِزَوْجِهَا كَأَنَّهُ يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهَا»</div><p>(No woman should describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he is looking at her.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Ibn Mas`ud.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُهُنَّ</div><p>(or their right hand possessions. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means from among the women of the idolators. It is permissible for a Muslim woman to reveal her adornment before such a woman, even if she is an idolatress, because she is her slave-girl.\" This was also the view of Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib. Allah says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوِ التَّـبِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِى الإِرْبَةِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ</div><p>(Tabi`in among men who do not have desire,) such as hired servants and followers who are not at the same level as the woman and are feeble-minded and have no interest in or desire for women. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is the kind of person who has no desire.\" `Ikrimah said, \"This is the hermaphrodite, who does not experience erections.\" This was also the view of others among the Salaf. It was narrated in the Sahih from `A'ishah that a hermaphrodite, used to enter upon the family of the Messenger of Allah and they used to consider him as one of those who do not have desire, but then the Messenger of Allah came in when he was describing a woman with four rolls of fat in front and eight behind. The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا أَرَى هَذَا يَعْلَمُ مَا هَهُنَا لَا يَدْخُلَنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ»</div><p>(Lo! I think this person knows what is they are; he should never enter upon you.) He expelled him, and he stayed in Al-Bayda' and only came on Fridays to get food.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوِ الطِّفْلِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَى عَوْرَتِ النِّسَآءِ</div><p>(or children who are not aware of the nakedness of women. ) Because they are so young they do not understand anything about women or their `Awrah or their soft speech or their enticing ways of walking and moving. If a child is small and does not understand that, there is nothing wrong with him entering upon women, but if he is an adolescent or approaching adolescence, so that he knows and understands these things, and can make a distinction between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not enter upon women. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالدُّخُولَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ»</div><p>(Avoid entering upon women.) It was said, \"O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the male in-laws\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْحَمْوُ: الْمَوْتُ»</div><p>(The male in-law is death.)</p><h2>The Etiquette of Women walking in the Street</h2><p>Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ</div><p>(And let them not stamp their feet...) During Jahiliyyah, when women walked in the street wearing anklets and no one could hear them, they would stamp their feet so that men could hear their anklets ringing. Allah forbade the believing women to do this. By the same token, if there is any other kind of adornment that is hidden, women are forbidden to make any movements that would reveal what is hidden, because Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ</div><p>(And let them not stamp their feet...) to the end of it. From that, women are also prohibited from wearing scent and perfume when they are going outside the home, lest men should smell their perfume. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ عَيْنٍ زَانِيَةٌ، وَالْمَرْأَةُ إِذَا اسْتَعْطَرَتْ فَمَرَّتْ بِالْمَجْلِسِ فَهِيَ كَذَا وَكَذَا»</div><p>(Every eye commits fornication and adultery, and when a woman puts on perfume and passes through a gathering, she is such and such) -- meaning an adulteress. He said, \"And there is a similar report from Abu Hurayrah, and this is Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. By the same token, women are also forbidden to walk in the middle of the street, because of what this involves of wanton display. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Usayd Al-Ansari said that he heard the Messenger of Allah , as he was coming out of the Masjid and men and women were mixing in the street, telling the women:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْتَأْخِرْنَ فَإِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَكُنَّ أَنْ تَحْقُقْنَ الطَّرِيقَ، عَلَيْكُنَّ بِحَافَّاتِ الطَّرِيقِ»</div><p>(Keep back, for you have no right to walk in the middle of the street. You should keep to the sides of the road.) The women used to cling to the walls so much that their clothes would catch on the walls.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتُوبُواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.) means, practice what you are commanded in these beautiful manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and give up the evil ways of the people of Jahiliyyah, for the greatest success is to be found in doing what Allah and His Messenger command and avoiding what He forbids. And Allah is the source of strength.</p>"

Whoever cannot do that, then let him fast, for it is a protection for him.) This was recorded in the Two Sahihs from the Hadith of Ibn Mas`ud. In the Sunan, it was recorded from more than one person that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَزَوَّجُوا تَوَالَدُوا تَنَاسَلُوا فَإِنِّي مُبَاهٍ بِكُمُ الْأُمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ»</div><p>(Marry and have children, for I will be proud of you before the nations on the Day of Resurrection.) The word Al-Ayama, the plural form of Ayyim, is used to describe a woman who has no husband and a man who has no wife, regardless of whether they have been married and then separated, or have never been married at all. Al-Jawhari reported this from the scholars of the (Arabic) language, and the word is applied to men and women alike.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَكُونُواْ فُقَرَآءَ يُغْنِهِمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Allah encouraged them to get married, commanded both free men and servants to get married, and He promised to enrich them.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَكُونُواْ فُقَرَآءَ يُغْنِهِمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty.)

Al-Baghawi also recorded something similar from `Umar. It was reported from Al-Layth from Muhammad bin `Ajlan from Sa`id Al-Maqburi from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ثَلَاثَةٌ حَقٌّ عَلَى اللهِ عَوْنُهُمْ: النَّاكِحُ يُرِيدُ الْعَفَافَ، وَالْمُكَاتَبُ يُرِيدُ الْأَدَاءَ، وَالْغَازِي فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ»</div><p>(There are three whom it is a right upon Allah to help: one who gets married seeking chastity; a slave who makes a contract with his master with the aim of buying his freedom; and one who fights for the sake of Allah.) This was recorded by Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. The Prophet performed the marriage of a man who owned nothing but his waist wrap, and could not even buy a ring made of iron, but he still married him to that woman, making the Mahr his promise to teach her whatever he knew of the Qur'an. And it is known from the generosity and kindness of Allah that He provided him with whatever was sufficient for her and for him.</p><h2>The Command to keep Oneself Chaste if One is not able to get married</h2><p>Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحاً حَتَّى يُغْنِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.) This is a command from Allah to those who do not have the means to get married: they are to keep themselves chaste and avoid unlawful things, as the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الشَّبَابِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمُ الْبَاءَةَ فَلْيَتَزَوَّجْ فَإِنَّهُ أَغَضُّ لِلْبَصَرِ وَأَحْصَنُ لِلْفَرْجِ، وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَيْهِ بِالصَّوْمِ فَإِنَّهُ لَهُ وِجَاءٌ»</div><p>(O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him marry, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and protecting the private parts.

This Ayah is general in meaning, and the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa' is more specific, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ الْمُحْصَنَـتِ</div><p>(And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women)until His statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(but it is better for you that you practise self-restraint) 4:25 meaning, it is better for you to be patient and refrain from marrying slave-girl, because any child that is born will also be a slave.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) 4:25.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحاً</div><p>(And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste,) `Ikrimah said, \"This refers to a man who sees a woman and it is as if he feels desire; if he has a wife then let him go to her and fulfill his desire with her, and if he does not have a wife, then let him ponder the kingdom of heaven and earth until Allah grants him means of livelihood.\"</p><h2>The Command to grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ الْكِتَـبَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ فَكَـتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمُتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً</div><p>(And such of your servants as seek a writing (of emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them.) This is a command from Allah to slave-owners: if their servants ask them for a contract of emancipation, they should write it for them, provided that the servant has some skill and means of earning so that he can pay his master the money that is stipulated in the contract. Al-Bukhari said: \"Rawh narrated from Ibn Jurayj: `I said to `Ata', \"If I know that my servant has money, is it obligatory for me to write him a contract of emancipation\" He said, \"I do not think it can be anything but obligatory.\" `Amr bin Dinar said: \"I said to `Ata', `Are you narrating this from anybody' He said, `No,' then he told me that Musa bin Anas told him that Sirin, who had a lot of money, asked Anas for a contract of emancipation and he refused. So he went to `Umar (bin Al-Khattab), may Allah be pleased with him, and he said, `Write it for him.' He refused, so `Umar hit him with his whip and recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَـتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمُتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً</div><p>(give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them.)Then he wrote the contract.\" This was mentioned by Al-Bukhari with a disconnected chain of narration. It was also narrated by `Abdur-Razzaq who said Ibn Jurayj told them: I said to `Ata', \"If I know that my servant has some money, is it obligatory for me to write him a contract of emancipation\" He said, `I do not think it can be anything but obligatory.\"' It was also said by `Amr bin Dinar who said, \"I said to `Ata', `Are you narrating this from anybody' He said, `No.\"' Ibn Jarir recorded that Sirin wanted Anas bin Malik to write a contract of emancipation and he delayed, then `Umar said to him, \"You should certainly write him a contract of emancipation.\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih. Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ عَلِمُتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً</div><p>(if you find that there is good and honesty in them.) Some of them said (this means) trustworthiness. Some said: \"Honesty,\" and others said: \"A skill and ability to earn.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُوهُمْ مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِى ءَاتَـكُمْ</div><p>(And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you.) This is the share of the wealth of Zakah that Allah stated to be their right. This is the opinion of Al-Hasan, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and his father and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It was also the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُوهُمْ مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِى ءَاتَـكُمْ</div><p>(And give them something out of the wealth of Allah which He has bestowed upon you. ) Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"This is urging the people, their masters and others.\" This was also the view of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Al-Aslami and Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Allah commanded the believers to help in freeing slaves.\"</p><h2>The Prohibition of forcing One's Slave-Girls to commit Zina ®257</h2><p>؛ Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَـتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَآءِ</div><p>(And force not your slave-girls to prostitution...) Among the people of the Jahiliyyah, there were some who, if he had a slave-girl, he would send her out to commit Zina and would charge money for that, which he would take from her every time. When Islam came, Allah forbade the believers to do that. The reason why this Ayah was revealed, according to the reports of a number of earlier and later scholars of Tafsir, had to do with `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. He had slave-girls whom he used to force into prostitution so that he could take their earnings and because he wanted them to have children which would enhance his status, or so he claimed.</p><h2>Reports narrated on this Topic</h2><p>In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ahmad bin `Amr bin `Abd Al-Khaliq Al-Bazzar, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Az-Zuhri said, \"`Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul had a slave-girl whose name was Mu`adhah, whom he forced into prostitution. When Islam came, the Ayah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَـتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَآءِ</div><p>(And force not your slave-girls to prostitution...) was revealed.\" Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Sufyan that Jabir said concerning this Ayah, \"This was revealed about a slave-girl belonging to `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul whose name was Musaykah. He used to force her to commit immoral actions, but there was nothing wrong with her and she refused. Then Allah revealed this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَـتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَآءِ</div><p>(And force not your slave-girls to prostitution,) until His saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُكْرِههُنَّ فِإِنَّ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(But if anyone compels them, then after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)\" An-Nasa'i also recorded something similar. Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"I heard -- and Allah knows best -- that this Ayah was revealed about two men who used to force two slave-girls of theirs (into prostitution). One of them was called Musaykah who belonged to the Ansari, and Umaymah the mother of Musaykah belonged to `Abdullah bin Ubayy. Mu`adhah and Arwa were in the same situation. Then Musaykah and her mother came to the Prophet and told him about that. Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَـتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَآءِ</div><p>(And force not your slave-girls to prostitution), meaning Zina.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّناً</div><p>(if they desire chastity,) means, if they want to be chaste, which is the case with the majority of slave-girls.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّتَبْتَغُواْ عَرَضَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(in order that you may make a gain in the goods of this worldly life.) meaning, from the money they earn and their children. The Messenger of Allah forbade the money earned by the cupper, the prostitute and the fortune-teller. According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَهْرُ الْبَغِيِّ خَبِيثٌ وَكَسْبُ الْحَجَّامِ خَبِيثٌ، وَثَمَنُ الْكَلْبِ خَبِيثٌ»</div><p>(The earnings of a prostitute are evil, the earnings of a cupper are evil, and the price of a dog is evil.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُكْرِههُنَّ فِإِنَّ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(But if anyone compels them, then after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) meaning, towards them, as has already been stated in the Hadith narrated from Jabir. Ibn Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If you do that, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful, and their sin will be on the one who forced them to do that.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Al-A`mash and Qatadah. After explaining these rulings in detail, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتٍ مُّبَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(And indeed We have sent down for you Ayat that make things plain,) meaning, in the Qur'an there are Ayat which are clear and explain matters in detail.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَثَلاً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ</div><p>(and the example of those who passed away before you,) means, reports about the nations of the past and what happened to them when they went against the commandments of Allah, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) 43:56; We made them a lesson, i.e., a rebuke for committing sin and forbidden deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(for those who have Taqwa. ) meaning, for those who remember and fear Allah.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Parable of the Light of Allah</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) means, the Guide of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. Ibn Jurayj said: \"Mujahid and Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) He is controlling their affairs and their stars and sun and moon.\" As-Suddi said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.) by His Light the heavens and earth are illuminated. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When the Messenger of Allah got up to pray at night, he would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ، أَنْتَ قَيِّمُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ، وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ نُورُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ»</div><p>(O Allah, to You be praise, You are the Sustainer of heaven and earth and whoever is in them. To You be praise, You are the Light of the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them. ) It was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"There is no night or day with your Lord; the Light of the Throne comes from the Light of His Face.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَثَلُ نُورِهِ</div><p>(The parable of His Light) There are two views concerning the meaning of the pronoun (His). The first is that it refers to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, meaning that the parable of His guidance in the heart of the believer is</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمِشْكَاةٍ</div><p>(as a niche) This was the view of Ibn `Abbas. The second view is that the pronoun refers to the believer, which is indicated by the context of the words and implies that the parable of the light in the heart of the believer is as a niche. So the heart of the believer and what he is naturally inclined to of guidance and what he learns of the Qur'an which is in accordance with his natural inclinations are, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ</div><p>(Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites it (can they be equal with the disbelievers)) 11:17. The heart of the believer in its purity and clarity is likened to a lamp in transparent and jewel-like glass, and the Qur'an and Shari`ah by which it is guided are likened to good, pure, shining oil in which there is no impurity or deviation.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمِشْكَاةٍ</div><p>(as (if there were) a niche) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and others said, \"This refers to the position of the wick in the lamp.\" This is well-known, and hence Allah then says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ</div><p>(and within it a lamp.) This is the flame that burns brightly. Or it was said that the niche is a niche in the house. This is the parable given by Allah of obedience towards Him. Allah calls obedience to Him as light, then He calls it by other numerous names as well. Ubayy bin Ka`b said, \"The lamp is the light, and this refers to the Qur'an and the faith that is in his heart.\" As-Suddi said, \"It is the lamp.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمِصْبَاحُ فِى زُجَاجَةٍ</div><p>(the lamp is in a glass,) means, this light is shining in a clear glass. Ubayy bin Ka`b and others said, \"This is the likeness of the heart of the believer.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّىٌّ</div><p>(the glass as it were a star Durriyyun,) Some authorities recite the word Durriyyun with a Dammah on the Dal and without a Hamzah, which means pearls, i.e., as if it were a star made of pearls (Durr). Others recite it as Dirri'un or Durri'un, with a Kasrah on the Dal, or Dammah on the Dal, and with a Hamzah at the end, which means reflection (Dir'), because if something is shone on the star it becomes brighter than at any other time. The Arabs call the stars they do not know Darari. Ubayy bin Ka`b said: a shining star. Qatadah said: \"Huge, bright and clear.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَـرَكَةٍ</div><p>(lit from a blessed tree,) means, it is derived from olive oil, from a blessed tree.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">زَيْتُونَةٍ</div><p>(an olive,) This refers to the blessed tree mentioned previously.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ</div><p>(neither of the east nor of the west,) means, it is not in the eastern part of the land so that it does not get any sun in the first part of the day, nor is it in the western part of the land so that it is shaded from the sun before sunset, but it is in a central position where it gets sun from the beginning of the day until the end, so its oil is good and pure and shining. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">زَيْتُونَةٍ لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ</div><p>(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west,) \"This is a tree in the desert which is not shaded by any other tree or mountain or cave, nothing covers it, and this is best for its oil.\" Mujahid commented on:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ</div><p>(neither of the east nor of the west, ) saying; \"It is not in the east where it will get no sun when the sun sets, nor is it in the west where it will get no sun when the sun rises, but it is in a position where it will get sun both at sunrise and sunset.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr commented:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">زَيْتُونَةٍ لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِىءُ</div><p>(an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself)) \"This is the best kind of oil. When the sun rises it reaches the tree from the east and when it sets it reaches it from the west, so the sun reaches it morning and evening, so it is not counted as being in the east or in the west.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِىءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ</div><p>(whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it.) `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said (this means) because the oil itself is shining.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُّورٌ عَلَى نُورٍ</div><p>(Light upon Light!) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that this meant the faith and deeds of a person. As-Suddi said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُّورٌ عَلَى نُورٍ</div><p>(Light upon Light!) \"Light of the fire and the light of the oil: when they are combined they give light, and neither of them can give light without the other. Similarly the light of the Qur'an and the light of faith give light when they are combined, and neither can do so without the other.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَهْدِى اللَّهُ لِنُورِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Allah guides to His Light whom He wills.) means, Allah shows the way to the ones whom He chooses, as it says in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr, who said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى خَلَقَ خَلْقَهُ فِي ظُلْمَةٍ ثُمَّ أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ نُورِهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ، فَمَنْ أَصَابَ مِنْ نُورِهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ اهْتَدَى وَمَنْ أَخْطَأَ ضَلَّ فَلِذَلِكَ أَقُولُ: جَفَّ الْقَلَمُ عَلَى عِلْمِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ»</div><p>(Allah created His creation in darkness, then on the same day He sent His Light upon them. Whoever was touched by His Light on that day will be guided and whoever was missed will be led astray. Hence I say: the pens have dried in accordance with the knowledge of Allah, may He be glorified.)\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلَيِمٌ</div><p>(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) Having mentioned this parable of the Light of His guidance in the heart of the believer, Allah ends this Ayah with the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلَيِمٌ</div><p>(And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything.) meaning, He knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be led astray. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْقُلُوبُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: قَلْبٌ أَجْرَدُ فِيهِ مِثْلُ السِّرَاجِ يُزْهِرُ، وَقَلْبٌ أَغْلَفُ مَرْبُوطٌ عَلَى غِلَافِهِ، وَقَلْبٌ مَنْكُوسٌ، وَقَلْبٌ مُصْفَحٌ. فَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَجْرَدُ: فَقَلْبُ الْمُؤْمِنِ سِرَاجُهُ فِيهِ نُورُهُ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَغْلَفُ فَقَلْبُ الْكَافِرِ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمَنْكُوسُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُنَافِقِ، عَرَفَ ثُمَّ أَنْكَرَ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمُصْفَحُ فَقَلْبٌ فِيهِ إِيمَانٌ وَنِفَاقٌ، وَمَثَلُ الْإِيمَانِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْبَقْلَةِ يُمِدُّهَا الْمَاءُ الطَّيِّبُ،وَمَثَلُ النِّفَاقِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْقَرْحَةِ يُمِدُّهَا الدَّمُ وَالْقَيْحُ، فَأَيُّ الْمدَّتَيْنِ غَلَبَتْ عَلَى الْأُخْرَى غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ»</div><p>(Hearts are of four kinds: the heart that is clear like a shining lamp; the heart that is covered and tied up; the heart that is upside-down; and the heart that is clad in armor. As for the clear heart, it is the heart of the believer in which is a lamp filled with light; as for the covered heart, this is the heart of the disbeliever; as for the upside-down heart, this is the heart of the hypocrite, who recognizes then denies; as for the armor-clad heart, this is the heart in which there is both faith and hypocrisy. The parable of the faith in it is that of legume, a sprout that is irrigated with good water, and the likeness of the hypocrisy in it is that of sores that are fed by blood and pus. Whichever of the two prevails is the characteristic that will dominate.) Its chain of narrators is good (Jayyid) although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Virtues of the Masjids, the Correct Etiquette, and the Virtues of Those who take care of them</h2><p>Having likened the heart of the believer and what it contains of guidance and knowledge to a lamp lit with good oil shining in a clear glass, Allah then states where it belongs, which is in the Masjids, the places on earth that are most beloved to Allah. The Masjids are His houses where He Alone is worshipped. So Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ</div><p>(In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) meaning, Allah has commanded that they be established and that they be kept clean of any filth, idle talk or words or deeds that are inappropriate. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ</div><p>(In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) he said; \"Allah forbade idle talk in them.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Nafi` bin Jubayr, Abu Bakr bin Sulayman bin Abi Hathamah, Sufyan bin Husayn and others among the scholars of Tafsir. Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the construction of Masjids, honoring them, respecting them, and perfuming them with incense etc. This has been discussed in more detail elsewhere, and I have written a book dealing with this topic on its own, praise and blessings be to Allah. With Allah's help we will mention here a few of these Hadiths, if Allah wills. In Allah we put our trust and reliance. `Uthman bin `Affan, the Commander of the faithful, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَنَى مَسْجِدًا يَبْتَغِي بِهِ وَجْهَ اللهِ بَنَى اللهُ لَهُ مِثْلَهُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ»</div><p>(Whoever builds a Masjid seeking the Face of Allah, Allah will build for him something similar to it in Paradise.) It was narrated in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Majah narrated that `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَنَى مَسْجِدًا يُذْكَرُ فِيهِ اسْمُ اللهِ بَنَى اللهُ لَهُ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ»</div><p>(Whoever builds a Masjid in which the Name of Allah is remembered, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.) An-Nasa'i mentioned something similar. There are very many Hadiths which say this. `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"The Messenger of Allah commanded us to build Masjids among the houses, and to clean them and perfume them.\" This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers with the exception of An-Nasa'i. Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded a similar report from Samurah bin Jundub.Al-Bukhari said: \"`Umar said: `Build for the people a place to worship Allah, and beware of using red or yellow for adornment and decoration and distracting the people thereby.\"' Abu Dawud narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا أُمِرْتُ بِتَشْيِيدِ الْمَسَاجِدِ»</div><p>(I was not commanded to Tashyid the Masjids.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Decorating them as the Jews and Christians did.\" Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى يَتَبَاهَى النَّاسُ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ»</div><p>(The Hour will not come until people show off in building Masjids.) It was recorded by Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, with the exception of At-Tirmidhi.Buraydah narrated that a man called out in the Masjid and said, \"Has any body said anything about a red camel\" The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، وَجَدْتَ، إِنَّمَا بُنِيَتِ الْمَسَاجِدُ لِمَا بُنِيَتْ لَهُ»</div><p>(May you never find it! The Masjids were built only for what they were built for.) This was narrated by Muslim. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَبِيعُ أَوْ يَبْتَاعُ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ، فَقُولُوا: لَا أَرْبَحَ اللهُ تِجَارَتَكَ، وَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَنْشُدُ ضَالَّةً فِي الْمَسْجِدِ فَقُولُوا: لَا رَدَّهَا اللهُ عَلَيْكَ»</div><p>(If you see someone buying or selling in the Masjid, say to him, \"May Allah never make your business profitable!\" And if you see someone calling out about lost property, say, \"May Allah never return it to you!\") This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said: \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid Al-Kindi said, \"I was standing in the Masjid and a man threw pebbles at me, so I looked and saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab who said, `Go and bring me these two men.' I went and brought them to him, and he said, `Who are you' Or, `Where do you come from' They said, `We are from At-Ta'if.' `Umar said, `If you had been from this town I would have hit you, for you are raising your voices in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah .\"' An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: \"`Umar heard the voice of a man in the Masjid and said: `Do you know where you are\"' This is also Sahih. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Musili recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar used to burn incense in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah every Friday. Its chain of narration is Hasan and there is nothing wrong with it, Allah knows best. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي الْجَمَاعَةِ تُضَعَّفُ عَلَى صَلَاتِهِ فِي بَيْتِهِ وَفِي سُوقِهِ خَمْسًا وَعِشْرِينَ ضِعْفًاوَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ إَذَا تَوَضَّأَ فَأَحْسَنَ وُضُوءَهُ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ لَا يُخْرِجُهُ إِلَّا الصَّلَاةُ لَمْ يَخْطُ خَطْوَةً إِلَّا رُفِعَ لَهُ بِهَا دَرَجَةٌ وَحُطَّ عَنْهُ بِهَا خَطِيئَةٌ. فَإِذَا صَلَّى لَمْ تَزَلِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ تُصَلِّي عَلَيْهِ مَا دَامَ فِي مُصَلَّاهُ: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ، اللَّهُمَّ ارْحَمْهُ. وَلَا يَزَالُ فِي صَلَاةٍ مَا انْتَظَرَ الصَّلَاةَ»</div><p>(A man's prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his prayer in his house or the marketplace. That is because if he performs Wudu' and does it well, then he goes out to go to the Masjid, and for no other purpose than to pray, he does not take one step but he increases in one level in status and one sin is removed. When he prays, the angels continue sending blessings on him as long as he is in the place where he prays, they say, \"O Allah, send blessings on him, O Allah, have mercy on him.\" And he will remain in a state of prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer.) The following is recorded in the Sunan:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَشِّرِ الْمَشَّائِينَ إِلَى الْمَسَاجِدِ فِي الظُّلَمِ بِالنُّورِ التَّامِّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ»</div><p>(Those who walk to the Masjids when it is dark, give them the glad tidings of complete Light on the Day of Resurrection.) When entering the Masjid, it is recommended to enter with one's right foot, and to say the supplication recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari, where it is narrated from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah used to say, when he entered the Masjid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ، وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ، مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(I seek refuge with Allah Almighty and with His Noble Face, and with His Eternal Domain, from the accursed Shaytan.) He (one of the narrators) asked, `Is that all' He answered, `Yes'. If he says this, the Shaytan says: \"He will be protected from me all day long.\" Muslim recorded that Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ.وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me. And when he comes out, let him say: \"O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty.\") An-Nasa'i also recorded this from them from the Prophet . Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ. وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ، وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ اعْصِمْنِي مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet then let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me.\" When he comes out, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet and say, \"O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan.\") This was also recorded by Ibn Majah, as well as Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban in their Sahihs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ</div><p>(in them His Name is remembered.) meaning, the Name of Allah. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـبَنِى ءَادَمَ خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ</div><p>(O Children of Adam! Take your adornment to every Masjid...) 7:31</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقِيمُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَادْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ</div><p>(and you should face (Him only) in each and every Masjid, and invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him) 7:29.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَـجِدَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And the Masjids are for Allah) 72:18.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ</div><p>(in them His Name is remembered.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means that His Book is recited therein.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالاٌّصَالِ</div><p>(Therein glorify Him in the mornings and in the evenings.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَلُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah.) 63:9</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْاْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُواْ الْبَيْعَ</div><p>(O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business.) 62:9 Allah says that this world and its adornments, attractions and marketplaces should not distract them from remembering their Lord Who created them and sustains them, those who know that what is with Him is better for them than what they themselves possess, because what they have is transient but that which is with Allah is eternal. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَوةِ وَإِيتَآءِ الزَّكَـوةِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah nor from performing the Salah nor from giving the Zakah). meaning, they give priority to obeying Allah and doing what He wants and what pleases Him over doing what they want and what pleases them.

The Masjids are His houses where He Alone is worshipped. So Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ</div><p>(In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) meaning, Allah has commanded that they be established and that they be kept clean of any filth, idle talk or words or deeds that are inappropriate. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ</div><p>(In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) he said; \"Allah forbade idle talk in them.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Nafi` bin Jubayr, Abu Bakr bin Sulayman bin Abi Hathamah, Sufyan bin Husayn and others among the scholars of Tafsir. Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the construction of Masjids, honoring them, respecting them, and perfuming them with incense etc. This has been discussed in more detail elsewhere, and I have written a book dealing with this topic on its own, praise and blessings be to Allah. With Allah's help we will mention here a few of these Hadiths, if Allah wills. In Allah we put our trust and reliance. `Uthman bin `Affan, the Commander of the faithful, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَنَى مَسْجِدًا يَبْتَغِي بِهِ وَجْهَ اللهِ بَنَى اللهُ لَهُ مِثْلَهُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ»</div><p>(Whoever builds a Masjid seeking the Face of Allah, Allah will build for him something similar to it in Paradise.) It was narrated in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Majah narrated that `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said; \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَنَى مَسْجِدًا يُذْكَرُ فِيهِ اسْمُ اللهِ بَنَى اللهُ لَهُ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ»</div><p>(Whoever builds a Masjid in which the Name of Allah is remembered, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.) An-Nasa'i mentioned something similar. There are very many Hadiths which say this. `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"The Messenger of Allah commanded us to build Masjids among the houses, and to clean them and perfume them.\" This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers with the exception of An-Nasa'i. Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded a similar report from Samurah bin Jundub.Al-Bukhari said: \"`Umar said: `Build for the people a place to worship Allah, and beware of using red or yellow for adornment and decoration and distracting the people thereby.\"' Abu Dawud narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا أُمِرْتُ بِتَشْيِيدِ الْمَسَاجِدِ»</div><p>(I was not commanded to Tashyid the Masjids.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Decorating them as the Jews and Christians did.\" Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى يَتَبَاهَى النَّاسُ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ»</div><p>(The Hour will not come until people show off in building Masjids.) It was recorded by Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, with the exception of At-Tirmidhi.Buraydah narrated that a man called out in the Masjid and said, \"Has any body said anything about a red camel\" The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، وَجَدْتَ، إِنَّمَا بُنِيَتِ الْمَسَاجِدُ لِمَا بُنِيَتْ لَهُ»</div><p>(May you never find it! The Masjids were built only for what they were built for.) This was narrated by Muslim. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَبِيعُ أَوْ يَبْتَاعُ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ، فَقُولُوا: لَا أَرْبَحَ اللهُ تِجَارَتَكَ، وَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَنْشُدُ ضَالَّةً فِي الْمَسْجِدِ فَقُولُوا: لَا رَدَّهَا اللهُ عَلَيْكَ»</div><p>(If you see someone buying or selling in the Masjid, say to him, \"May Allah never make your business profitable!\" And if you see someone calling out about lost property, say, \"May Allah never return it to you!\") This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said: \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid Al-Kindi said, \"I was standing in the Masjid and a man threw pebbles at me, so I looked and saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab who said, `Go and bring me these two men.' I went and brought them to him, and he said, `Who are you' Or, `Where do you come from' They said, `We are from At-Ta'if.' `Umar said, `If you had been from this town I would have hit you, for you are raising your voices in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah .\"' An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: \"`Umar heard the voice of a man in the Masjid and said: `Do you know where you are\"' This is also Sahih. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Musili recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar used to burn incense in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah every Friday. Its chain of narration is Hasan and there is nothing wrong with it, Allah knows best. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي الْجَمَاعَةِ تُضَعَّفُ عَلَى صَلَاتِهِ فِي بَيْتِهِ وَفِي سُوقِهِ خَمْسًا وَعِشْرِينَ ضِعْفًاوَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ إَذَا تَوَضَّأَ فَأَحْسَنَ وُضُوءَهُ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ لَا يُخْرِجُهُ إِلَّا الصَّلَاةُ لَمْ يَخْطُ خَطْوَةً إِلَّا رُفِعَ لَهُ بِهَا دَرَجَةٌ وَحُطَّ عَنْهُ بِهَا خَطِيئَةٌ. فَإِذَا صَلَّى لَمْ تَزَلِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ تُصَلِّي عَلَيْهِ مَا دَامَ فِي مُصَلَّاهُ: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ، اللَّهُمَّ ارْحَمْهُ. وَلَا يَزَالُ فِي صَلَاةٍ مَا انْتَظَرَ الصَّلَاةَ»</div><p>(A man's prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his prayer in his house or the marketplace. That is because if he performs Wudu' and does it well, then he goes out to go to the Masjid, and for no other purpose than to pray, he does not take one step but he increases in one level in status and one sin is removed. When he prays, the angels continue sending blessings on him as long as he is in the place where he prays, they say, \"O Allah, send blessings on him, O Allah, have mercy on him.\" And he will remain in a state of prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer.) The following is recorded in the Sunan:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَشِّرِ الْمَشَّائِينَ إِلَى الْمَسَاجِدِ فِي الظُّلَمِ بِالنُّورِ التَّامِّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ»</div><p>(Those who walk to the Masjids when it is dark, give them the glad tidings of complete Light on the Day of Resurrection.) When entering the Masjid, it is recommended to enter with one's right foot, and to say the supplication recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari, where it is narrated from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah used to say, when he entered the Masjid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ، وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ، مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(I seek refuge with Allah Almighty and with His Noble Face, and with His Eternal Domain, from the accursed Shaytan.) He (one of the narrators) asked, `Is that all' He answered, `Yes'. If he says this, the Shaytan says: \"He will be protected from me all day long.\" Muslim recorded that Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ.وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me. And when he comes out, let him say: \"O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty.\") An-Nasa'i also recorded this from them from the Prophet . Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ. وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ، وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ اعْصِمْنِي مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet then let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me.\" When he comes out, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet and say, \"O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan.\") This was also recorded by Ibn Majah, as well as Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban in their Sahihs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ</div><p>(in them His Name is remembered.) meaning, the Name of Allah. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـبَنِى ءَادَمَ خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ</div><p>(O Children of Adam!

Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means that His Book is recited therein.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالاٌّصَالِ</div><p>(Therein glorify Him in the mornings and in the evenings.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَلُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah.) 63:9</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْاْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُواْ الْبَيْعَ</div><p>(O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business.) 62:9 Allah says that this world and its adornments, attractions and marketplaces should not distract them from remembering their Lord Who created them and sustains them, those who know that what is with Him is better for them than what they themselves possess, because what they have is transient but that which is with Allah is eternal. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَوةِ وَإِيتَآءِ الزَّكَـوةِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah nor from performing the Salah nor from giving the Zakah). meaning, they give priority to obeying Allah and doing what He wants and what pleases Him over doing what they want and what pleases them. It was reported from Salim from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he was in the marketplace when the Iqamah for prayer was called, so they closed their stores and entered the Masjid. Ibn `Umar said: \"Concerning them the Ayah was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah).\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah). `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This meant from the prescribed prayers.\" This was also the view of Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas.

Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَبِيعُ أَوْ يَبْتَاعُ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ، فَقُولُوا: لَا أَرْبَحَ اللهُ تِجَارَتَكَ، وَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ مَنْ يَنْشُدُ ضَالَّةً فِي الْمَسْجِدِ فَقُولُوا: لَا رَدَّهَا اللهُ عَلَيْكَ»</div><p>(If you see someone buying or selling in the Masjid, say to him, \"May Allah never make your business profitable!\" And if you see someone calling out about lost property, say, \"May Allah never return it to you!\") This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said: \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid Al-Kindi said, \"I was standing in the Masjid and a man threw pebbles at me, so I looked and saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab who said, `Go and bring me these two men.' I went and brought them to him, and he said, `Who are you' Or, `Where do you come from' They said, `We are from At-Ta'if.' `Umar said, `If you had been from this town I would have hit you, for you are raising your voices in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah .\"' An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: \"`Umar heard the voice of a man in the Masjid and said: `Do you know where you are\"' This is also Sahih. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Musili recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar used to burn incense in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah every Friday. Its chain of narration is Hasan and there is nothing wrong with it, Allah knows best. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي الْجَمَاعَةِ تُضَعَّفُ عَلَى صَلَاتِهِ فِي بَيْتِهِ وَفِي سُوقِهِ خَمْسًا وَعِشْرِينَ ضِعْفًاوَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ إَذَا تَوَضَّأَ فَأَحْسَنَ وُضُوءَهُ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ لَا يُخْرِجُهُ إِلَّا الصَّلَاةُ لَمْ يَخْطُ خَطْوَةً إِلَّا رُفِعَ لَهُ بِهَا دَرَجَةٌ وَحُطَّ عَنْهُ بِهَا خَطِيئَةٌ. فَإِذَا صَلَّى لَمْ تَزَلِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ تُصَلِّي عَلَيْهِ مَا دَامَ فِي مُصَلَّاهُ: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ، اللَّهُمَّ ارْحَمْهُ. وَلَا يَزَالُ فِي صَلَاةٍ مَا انْتَظَرَ الصَّلَاةَ»</div><p>(A man's prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his prayer in his house or the marketplace. That is because if he performs Wudu' and does it well, then he goes out to go to the Masjid, and for no other purpose than to pray, he does not take one step but he increases in one level in status and one sin is removed. When he prays, the angels continue sending blessings on him as long as he is in the place where he prays, they say, \"O Allah, send blessings on him, O Allah, have mercy on him.\" And he will remain in a state of prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer.) The following is recorded in the Sunan:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَشِّرِ الْمَشَّائِينَ إِلَى الْمَسَاجِدِ فِي الظُّلَمِ بِالنُّورِ التَّامِّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ»</div><p>(Those who walk to the Masjids when it is dark, give them the glad tidings of complete Light on the Day of Resurrection.) When entering the Masjid, it is recommended to enter with one's right foot, and to say the supplication recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari, where it is narrated from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah used to say, when he entered the Masjid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ، وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ، مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(I seek refuge with Allah Almighty and with His Noble Face, and with His Eternal Domain, from the accursed Shaytan.) He (one of the narrators) asked, `Is that all' He answered, `Yes'. If he says this, the Shaytan says: \"He will be protected from me all day long.\" Muslim recorded that Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ.وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيَقُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me. And when he comes out, let him say: \"O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty.\") An-Nasa'i also recorded this from them from the Prophet . Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَحَدُكُمُ الْمَسْجِدَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ. وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ، وَإِذَا خَرَجَ فَلْيُسَلِّمْ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ وَلْيَقُلِ: اللَّهُمَّ اعْصِمْنِي مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ»</div><p>(When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet then let him say: \"O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me.\" When he comes out, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet and say, \"O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan.\") This was also recorded by Ibn Majah, as well as Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban in their Sahihs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ</div><p>(in them His Name is remembered.) meaning, the Name of Allah. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـبَنِى ءَادَمَ خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ</div><p>(O Children of Adam!

When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business.) 62:9 Allah says that this world and its adornments, attractions and marketplaces should not distract them from remembering their Lord Who created them and sustains them, those who know that what is with Him is better for them than what they themselves possess, because what they have is transient but that which is with Allah is eternal. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَوةِ وَإِيتَآءِ الزَّكَـوةِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah nor from performing the Salah nor from giving the Zakah). meaning, they give priority to obeying Allah and doing what He wants and what pleases Him over doing what they want and what pleases them. It was reported from Salim from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he was in the marketplace when the Iqamah for prayer was called, so they closed their stores and entered the Masjid. Ibn `Umar said: \"Concerning them the Ayah was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah).\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَـرَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah). `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This meant from the prescribed prayers.\" This was also the view of Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. As-Suddi said: \"From prayer in congregation.\" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"That does not distract them from attending the prayer and establishing it as Allah commanded them, and from doing the prayers at the prescribed times and doing all that Allah has enjoined upon them in the prayer.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخَـفُونَ يَوْماً تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ الْقُلُوبُ وَالاٌّبْصَـرُ</div><p>(They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned.) means, the Day of Resurrection when people's hearts and eyes will be overturned, because of the intensity of the fear and terror of that Day. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الاٌّزِفَةِ</div><p>(And warn them of the Day that is drawing near...) 40:18,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ</div><p>(but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror) 14:42.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً - إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لاَ نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءً وَلاَ شُكُوراً - إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْماً عَبُوساً قَمْطَرِيراً - فَوَقَـهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَلِكَ الْيَومِ وَلَقَّـهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُوراً - وَجَزَاهُمْ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ جَنَّةً وَحَرِيراً </div><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, (saying:) \"We feed you seeking Allah's Face only.

Similarly He sets forth two parables of the hypocrites at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah: one involving fire and the other involving water. Similarly, in Surat Ar-Ra`d He gives two parables of the guidance and knowledge that are instilled in the heart, again involving fire and water; we have discussed each of them in the appropriate place and there is no need to repeat it here, praise be to Allah. The first of these two examples is that of the disbelievers who call others to their disbelief, thinking that they have good actions and beliefs, when this is not in fact the case. Their likeness is that of a mirage which is seen in a desert plain, looking from a distance as if it is a deep sea. The word Qi`ah refers to a vast, flat, level area of land in which the mirage may appear. There are different kinds of mirage, one which appears after midday, and another which appears in the morning and looks like water between heaven and earth. If a person who is in need of water sees the mirage, he thinks that it is water so he heads towards it in order to drink from it, but when he reaches it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</div><p>(he finds it to be nothing.); Similarly the disbeliever thinks that he is doing something good and that he has achieved something, but when Allah judges him on the Day of Resurrection, and brings him to account and examines his deeds, he will find that nothing has been accepted at all, either because of a lack of sincere belief or because he did not follow the proper ways of the Shari`ah. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً </div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) 25:23.

And Allah is swift in taking account.) A similar view was also narrated from Ubayy bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others.

What do you want\" They will say, \"O Lord, we are thirsty, give us something to drink.\" It will be said to them, \"Do you not see\" Then Hell will be shown to them as if it is a mirage, parts of it consuming other parts, and they will go and fall into it.

      "text": "<h2>Allah's Promise to the Believers that He would grant them Succession</h2><p>This is a promise from Allah to His Messenger that He would cause his Ummah to become successors on earth, i.e., they would become the leaders and rulers of mankind, through whom He would reform the world and to whom people would submit, so that they would have in exchange a safe security after their fear. This is what Allah did indeed do, may He be glorified and exalted, and to Him be praise and blessings. For He did not cause His Messenger to die until He had given him victory over Makkah, Khaybar, Bahrayn, all of the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen; and he took Jizyah from the Zoroastrians of Hajar and from some of the border lands of Syria; and he exchanged gifts with Heraclius the ruler of Byzantium, the ruler of Egypt and Alexandria, the Muqawqis, the kings of Oman and An-Najashi of Abyssinia, who had become king after Ashamah, may Allah have mercy on him and grant him honor. Then when the Messenger died, his successor (Khalifah) Abu Bakr As-Siddiq took over the reins of power and united the Ummah, preventing its disintegration. He took control of the entire Arabian Peninsula, and he sent the Islamic armies to the land of Persia, under the leadership of Khalid bin Al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, who conquered a part of it and killed some of its people. He sent another army under the leadership of Abu `Ubaydah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the other commanders who came after him in the lands of Syria. He sent a third army under the leadership of `Amr bin Al-`As, may Allah be pleased with him, to Egypt. Allah enabled the army sent to Syria to conquer Busra and Damascus and their provinces the land of Hawran and its environs. Then Allah chose for Abu Bakr to honor him with Him and he died. The people of Islam were blessed that As-Siddiq was inspired to appoint `Umar Al-Faruq as his successor, so he took the reins of power after him and did a perfect job. After the Prophets, the world never saw anyone like `Umar in excellence of conduct and perfect justice. During his time, the rest of Syria and Egypt, and most of Persia, was conquered. Kisra was defeated and utterly humiliated, and he retreated to the furthest point of his kingdom. Mighty Caesar was brought low, his rule over Syria was overthrown, and he retreated to Constantinople. Their wealth was spent for the sake of Allah, as the Messenger of Allah had foretold and promised. May Allah's perfect peace and purest blessing be upon him. During the rule of `Uthman, the Islamic domains spread to the furthest points of the earth, east and west. The lands of the west were conquered as far as Cyprus and Andalusia, Kairouan and Sebta which adjoins the Atlantic Ocean. Towards the east, the conquests extended as far as China. Kisra was killed, his kingdom was utterly destroyed and the cities of Iraq, Khurasan and Al-Ahwaz were conquered. The Muslims killed a great number of Turks and Allah humiliated their great king Khaqan. Taxes were collected from the east and the west, and brought to the Commander of the faithful `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him. This was a blessing brought by his recitation and study of the Qur'an, and his bringing the Ummah together to preserve and protect it. In the Sahih it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ زَوَى لِيَ الْأَرْضَ فَرَأَيْتُ مَشَارِقَهَا وَمَغَارِبَهَا، وَسَيَبْلُغُ مُلْكُ أُمَّتِي مَا زُوِيَ لِي مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Allah showed me the earth and I looked at the east and the west. The dominion of my Ummah will reach everywhere I was shown.) And now we are enjoying that which Allah and His Messenger promised us, for Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. We ask Allah to give us faith in Him and His Messenger, and to help us to give thanks to Him in a manner that will earn us His pleasure.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدّلَنَّهُمْ مّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً</div><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them. And He will surely, give them in exchange a safe security after their fear...) Ar-Rabi` bin Anas narrated that Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"The Prophet and his Companions were in Makkah for nearly ten years, calling people in secret to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. They were in a state of fear and were not instructed to fight until after they were commanded to migrate to Al-Madinah. When they came to Al-Madinah, then Allah instructed them to fight. In Al-Madinah they were afraid and they carried their weapons morning and evening. This is how they remained for as long as Allah willed...\" Then Allah revealed this Ayah. He caused His Prophet to prevail over the Arabian Peninsula, and then they felt safe and put down their weapons. Then Allah took His Prophet and they remained safe throughout the time of Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman, until what happened happened, and fear again prevailed over them, so they instituted a police force and guards. They changed, so their situation changed. One of the Salaf said, \"The Khilafah of Abu Bakr and `Umar was true and adhered to the Book of Allah. Then he recited this Ayah.\" Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"This Ayah was revealed when we were in a state of extreme fear.\" This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرُواْ إِذْ أَنتُمْ قَلِيلٌ مُّسْتَضْعَفُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land) Until His statement:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(so that you might be grateful) 8:26.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ</div><p>(as He granted succession to those before them,) This is like the Ayah where Allah tells us that Musa said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(\"It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth...\") 7:129 And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land,) until the two Ayat there after. 28: 5-6</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ</div><p>(and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them...) vAs the Messenger of Allah said to `Adiyy bin Hatim when he came to him in a delegation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَعْرِفُ الْحِيرَةَ؟»</div><p>(Do you know Al-Hirah) He said, \"I do not know it, but I have heard of it.\" The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَيُتِمَّنَّ اللهُ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ حَتَّى تَخْرُجَ الظَّعِينَةُ مِنَ الْحِيرَةِ حَتَّى تَطُوفَ بِالْبَيْتِ فِي غَيْرِ جِوَارِ أَحَدٍ، وَلَتَفْتَحُنَّ كُنُوزَ كِسْرَى بْنِ هُرْمُزَ»</div><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, Allah will make this matter i.e., Islam prevail until a woman riding a camel will come from Al-Hirah and perform Tawaf around the House without needing the protection of anybody, and the treasures of Kisra the son of Hurmuz will be opened.) He said, \"Kisra the son of Hurmuz\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ، كِسْرَى بْنُ هُرْمُزَ، وَلَيُبْذَلَنَّ الْمَالُ حَتَّى لَا يَقْبَلَهُ أَحَدٌ»</div><p>(Yes, Kisra the son of Hurmuz, and wealth will be given until there will be no one who will accept it.) `Adiyy bin Hatim said: \"Now it is happening that a woman riding a camel comes from Al-Hirah and performs Tawaf around the House without needing the protection of anybody, and I was among those who opened the treasure of Kisra the son of Hurmuz. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the third thing will also come to pass, because the Messenger of Allah said it.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْبُدُونَنِى لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ بِى شَيْئاً</div><p>(if they worship Me and do not associate anything with Me.) Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that Mu`adh bin Jabal told him, \"While I was riding behind the Prophet on a donkey, with nothing between me and him but the back of his saddle, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مُعَاذُ بْنَ جَبَلٍ»</div><p>(O Mu`adh bin Jabal.) I said, `Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.' Then a while passed, then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مُعَاذُ بْنَ جَبَلٍ»</div><p>(O Mu`adh bin Jabal.) I said, `Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.' Then a while passed, then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مُعَاذُ بْنَ جَبَلٍ»</div><p>(O Mu`adh bin Jabal.) I said, `Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَلْ تَدْرِي مَا حَقُّ اللهِ عَلَى الْعِبَادِ؟»</div><p>(Do you know the rights that Allah has over His servants) I said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ حَقَّ اللهِ عَلَى الْعِبَادِ أَنْ يَعْبُدُوهُ وَلَا يُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(The rights that Allah has over His servants are that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him.) Then a while passed, then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مُعَاذُ بْنَ جَبَلٍ»</div><p>(O Mu`adh bin Jabal.) I said, `Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَهَلْ تَدْرِي مَا حَقُّ الْعِبَادِ عَلَى اللهِ إِذَا فَعَلُوا ذَلِكَ؟»</div><p>(Do you know the rights that people have over Allah if they do that) I said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنَّ حَقَّ الْعِبَادِ عَلَى اللهِ أَنْ لَا يُعَذِّبَهُمْ»</div><p>(The rights that people have over Allah is that He will not punish them.)\" This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذلِكَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ</div><p>(But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the rebellious.) means, `whoever then stops obeying Me after that, has stopped obeying the command of his Lord, and that is a great sin.' The Companions -- may Allah be pleased with them -- were the most committed of people after the Prophet to the commands of Allah and the most obedient to Allah. Their victories were in accordance with their level of commitment. They caused the Word of Allah to prevail in the east and the west, and Allah supported them so much that they governed all the people and all the lands. When the people subsequently fell short in their commitment to some of the commandments, their strength and victory fell short accordingly, but it is confirmed through more than one route in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ»</div><p>(There will remain a group of my Ummah adhering to the truth, and those who forsake them or oppose them will not harm them until the Day of Resurrection. ) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ كَذَلِكَ»</div><p>(.. until the command of Allah comes to pass and they are like that.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يُقَاتِلُوا الدَّجَّالَ»</div><p>(... until they fight the Dajjal.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَتَّى يَنْزِلَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَهُمْ ظَاهِرُونَ»</div><p>(... until `Isa bin Maryam comes down and they are prevailing.) All of these reports are Sahih, and there is no contradiction between them.</p>"

What was mentioned earlier in the Surah had to do with how unrelated people should seek permission to enter upon one another. Allah commanded the believers to ensure that their servants and their children who have not yet reached puberty should seek permission at three times: the first is before the Fajr prayer, because people are asleep in their beds at that time.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَـبَكُمْ مِّنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ</div><p>(and while you put off your clothes during the afternoon,) means, at the time of rest, because a man may be in a state of undress with his wife at that time.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن بَعْدِ صَلَوةِ الْعِشَآءِ</div><p>(and after the `Isha' prayer.) because this is the time for sleep. Servants and children are commanded not to enter upon household members at these times, because it is feared that a man may be in an intimate situation with his wife and so on.

      "text": "<h2>Eating from One's Relatives' Houses</h2><p>What is referred to here is the fact that they used to feel too embarrassed to eat with the blind, because they could not see the food or where the best morsels were, so others might take the best pieces before they could. They felt too embarrassed to eat with the lame because they could not sit comfortably, and their companions might take advantage of them, and they felt embarrassed to eat with the sick because they might not eat as much as others. So they were afraid to eat with them lest they were unfair to them in some way. Then Allah revealed this Ayah, granting them a dispensation in this matter. This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Miqsam. Ad-Dahhak said: \"Before the Prophet's Mission, they used to feel too embarrassed and too proud to eat with these people, lest they might have to help them. So Allah revealed this Ayah.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَى الاٌّعْمَى حَرَجٌ</div><p>(nor any restriction on the lame,) `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid said: \"A man would take a blind, lame or sick person to the house of his brother or sister or aunt, and those disabled people would feel ashamed of that and say, `they are taking us to other people's houses.' So this Ayah was revealed granting permission for that.\" As-Suddi said: \"A man would enter the house of his father or brother or son, and the lady of the house would bring him some food, but he would refrain from eating because the master of the house was not there, so Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَى الاٌّعْمَى حَرَجٌ</div><p>(There is no restriction on the blind. ..)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ مِن بُيُوتِكُمْ</div><p>(nor on yourselves, if you eat from your houses,) This is stated here although it is obvious, so that from this starting point the houses of others may be mentioned, and to make it clear that the ruling applies equally to what comes after. Sons' houses are included in this even though they are not mentioned by name, and this is used as evidence by those who regard the son's wealth as being like the father's wealth. In the Musnad and the Sunan, it is reported through several routes that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتَ وَمَالُكَ لِأَبِيكَ»</div><p>(You and your wealth belong to your father.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ بُيُوتِ ءَابَآئِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أُمَّهَـتِكُمْ</div><p>(or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers,) until His statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحهُ</div><p>(or (from that) whereof you hold keys,) This is obvious, and this is used as evidence by those who think that it is obligatory for relatives to spend on one another.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحهُ</div><p>(or (from that) whereof you hold keys,) Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said, \"This refers to a people's servants, whether a slave or otherwise. There is nothing wrong with them eating from the food that is stored with them, within reason.\" Az-Zuhri narrated from `Urwah that `A'isha, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"The Muslims used to go out on military campaigns with the Messenger of Allah and they would give their keys to people they trusted and say, `We permit you to eat whatever you need.' But they would say, `It is not permissible for us to eat, they have given us permission reluctantly and we are only trustees.' Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحهُ</div><p>(or (from that) whereof you hold keys).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ</div><p>(or (from the house) of a friend.) means, there is no sin on you if you eat from their houses, so long as you know that this does not upset them and they do not dislike it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ جَمِيعاً أَوْ أَشْتَاتاً</div><p>(No sin on you whether you eat together or apart.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah, \"When Allah revealed the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَـطِلِ</div><p>(O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly) 4: 29, the Muslims said, `Allah has forbidden us to eat up our property among ourselves unjustly, and food is the best of property, so it is not permissible for anyone among us to eat at the house of anyone else.' So the people stopped doing that. Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَى الاٌّعْمَى حَرَجٌ</div><p>(There is no restriction on the blind,) until His statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ</div><p>(or (from the house) of a friend.) A man would also feel embarrassed and would refrain from eating alone until someone else came along, but Allah made the matter easier for them and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ جَمِيعاً أَوْ أَشْتَاتاً</div><p>(No sin on you whether you eat together or apart.)\" Qatadah said, \"This was a clan of Banu Kinanah who during the Jahiliyyah thought that it was a source of shame for one of them to eat alone, to such an extent that a man might keep on driving his laden camel even though he was hungry, until he could find someone to eat and drink with him. Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ جَمِيعاً أَوْ أَشْتَاتاً</div><p>(No sin on you whether you eat together or apart.) So this was a dispensation from Allah, allowing people to eat either alone or with others, even though eating with others is more blessed and is better. Imam Ahmad recorded from Wahshi bin Harb from his father from his grandfather that a man said to the Prophet , \"We eat but we do not feel satisfied.\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَعَلَّكُمْ تَأْكُلُونَ مُتَفَرِّقِينَ، اجْتَمِعُوا عَلَى طَعَامِكُمْ، وَاذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللهِ، يُبَارَكْ لَكُمْ فِيهِ»</div><p>(Perhaps you are eating separately. Eat together and mention the Name of Allah, and He will bless the food for you.) It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah. Ibn Majah also recorded that Salim reported from his father from `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُوا جَمِيعًا، وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا، فَإِنَّ الْبَرَكَةَ مَعَ الْجَمَاعَةِ»</div><p>(Eat together and not separately, for the blessing is in being together.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمْ بُيُوتاً فَسَلِّمُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ</div><p>(But when you enter the houses, greet one another) Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri said, \"This means greet one another with Salam.\" Ibn Jurayj said: Abu Az-Zubayr said, \"I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah say, `When you enter upon your family, greet them with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good.' He said, `I do not think it is anything but obligatory.\"' Ibn Jurayj said: \"And Ziyad said that Ibn Tawus used to say: `When any one of you enters his house, let him say Salam.\"' Mujahid said: \"And when you enter the Masjid, say: `Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah'; when you enter upon your families, greet them with Salam; and when you enter a house in which there is nobody, say: `As-Salamu `Alayna wa `Ala `Ibad-Allah-is-Salihin (peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah).' This is what one is commanded to do, and it has been narrated to us that the angels will return his greeting.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat to you that you may understand.)

Qatadah said: \"Allah commanded that His Prophet should be treated with respect and honor, and that he should be a leader.\" Muqatil said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَجْعَلُواْ دُعَآءَ الرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضاً</div><p>(Make not the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one of another.) \"When you address him, do not say, `O Muhammad,' or `O son of `Abdullah'; rather honor him and say, `O Prophet of Allah,' or, `O Messenger of Allah.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تَجْعَلُواْ دُعَآءَ الرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضاً</div><p>(Make not the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one of another.) A second view concerning the meaning of the Ayah is that it means `do not think that if he prays against you it is like when anyone else prays against you, because his prayers will be answered; so beware lest he prays against you and you will be doomed.' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi. And Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ يَتَسَلَّلُونَ مِنكُمْ لِوَاذاً</div><p>(Allah knows those of you who slip away under shelter.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"This refers to the hypocrites who used to find it too difficult to listen to the Khutbah on Fridays, so they would hide behind some of the Companions of Muhammad and sneak out of the Masjid. It was not proper for a man to leave on Fridays once the Khutbah began, unless he had permission from the Prophet . If one of them wanted to leave, he would make a gesture to the Prophet with his finger, and the Prophet would give permission without the man speaking. This is because if the Prophet was giving the Khutbah and a man spoke, it would invalidate his Friday prayer.\" As-Suddi said, \"If they were with him for a congregational prayer, they would hide behind one another so that he could not see them.\"</p><h2>The Prohibition of going against the Messenger's Commandment</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَـلِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ</div><p>(And let those beware who oppose the Messenger's commandment) This means going against the commandment of the Prophet , which is his way, methodology and Sunnah. All words and deeds will be measured against his words and deeds; those that are in accordance with his words and deeds will be accepted, and whatever does not match up will be rejected, no matter who the person is who said and did them. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs and elsewhere that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ»</div><p>(Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected.) meaning, let those beware who go against the Shari`ah of the Messenger , in secret and in the open,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(lest some Fitnah should befall them), i.e., lest some disbelief or hypocrisy or innovation enter their hearts.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(or a painful torment be inflicted on them.) means in this world afflicting them with capital punishment, or by law of prescribed punishment, or by confinement in prison, or so on. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهَا جَعَلَ الْفَرَاشُ وَهَذِهِ الدَّوَابُّ اللَّائِي يَقَعْنَ فِي النَّارِ يَقَعْنَ فِيهَا، وَجَعَلَ يَحْجُزُهُنَّ وَيَغْلِبْنَهُ فَيَقْتَحِمْنَ فِيهَا قَالَ: فَذَلِكَ مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ، أَنَا آخِذٌ بِحُجَزِكُمْ عَنِ النَّارِ هَلُمَّ عَنِ النَّارِ، فَتَغْلِبُونِي وَتَقْتَحِمُونَ فِيهَا»</div><p>(The parable of me and you is as the example of a man who kindled a fire and when it illuminated all around him, moths and other creatures started falling into the fire, and he was trying to stop them but they overwhelmed him and still kept falling in. This is the parable of me and you. I am trying to restrain you and keep you away from the fire, but you overwhelm me and fall in.) This was also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.</p>"
