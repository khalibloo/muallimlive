A minor incident took place during this campaign, which the hypocrites of Madinah chose to misrepresent in order to defame ‘A’ishah, the Prophet’s wife, and create trouble for the Prophet Muhammad. In this chapter, on the one hand, ‘A’ishah has been completely exonerated, and on the other hand, legal provisions to be enforced under similar social circumstances, have been laid down. In Islamic law, zina i.e. an illicit sexual relationship (which includes in its definition fornication, adultery and rape) is an extremely serious offence. Giving a hundred lashes to a man or woman indulging in adultery is the punishment prescribed for illicit relations between unmarried persons. The purpose of meting out punishment in public is to add a deterrent aspect to the penal provision. The idea is that, after seeing the fate of the guilty persons in question, anyone who has any intention of committing such a crime will desist from doing so. If men or women guilty of illicit sexual relations repent and reform after punishment, they may again resume the lives of believers. But, if they fail to do so, they can no longer be accepted in Islamic society as being fit for marital relations.</p>"

And when the reality becomes clear, it becomes even more evident that the preacher is on the right path, so that those wavering on this score enter the realm of certainty. They come to realize that indeed the opponents of God’s envoy have nothing to offer except false allegations and baseless accusations. The main active participant in the campaign to vilify ‘A’ishah was the notorious hypocrite, ‘Abdullah ibn Ubayy. But he was not given any punishment whatsoever. He died a natural death, but severe punishment in the Hereafter was announced for him in the Quran. After the incident mentioned above, ‘Umar suggested to the Prophet Muhammad that he, (‘Abdullah ibn Ubayy), be put to death. The Prophet replied, ‘Oh, ‘Umar! What would happen if people started saying that Muhammad killed his own Companions?’ We gather from this that policy considerations sometimes warrant even major criminals being spared the punishment they deserve in this world, leaving their ultimate fate to be decided in the Hereafter.</p>"

In Islam, help is to be given to needy persons on account of their being needy and not on any other grounds. Therefore, the aforementioned Quranic verses were revealed ordering that those who could should not stop giving monetary help to those in need on account of personal grudges. They were asked whether they did not want to be pardoned by God and told that if they expected God’s forgiveness, they too should adopt a forgiving attitude towards others. On hearing this verse, Abu Bakr said: ‘Yes ! By God! We want You to forgive us; O! Lord of ours!’ and he started helping Mistah once again. In the eyes of a believer, God’s commands are of the utmost importance.

That portion of a male’s body, which is required to be kept covered at all times, is from the navel down to the knees, including the knees. This is satr, which is obligatory before all except one’s wife, or where some need arises by which prohibitions are relaxed, for instance, in the case of medical examinations. The second important thing is that when a man and a woman happen to confront each other, the man should keep his eyes cast down. A casual meeting between a man and a woman who are not married or who are not very close relatives, should never be as informal as that between any two men. During any casual meeting between a man and a woman, the man should keep his eyes down and if a man happens to accidentally cast a glance at an unknown woman, he should immediately direct his gaze elsewhere and should not deliberately look at her again. The instructions about looking down and concealing the private parts of the body are also applicable to women, as is made clear in the next verse (Verse 31).</p>"

The literal meaning of ‘O! You Believers! Turn all together towards God,’ is that in carrying out the instructions of the Islamic law, the most important virtues are the receptivity and sincerity of people’s hearts. The male and female Companions of the Prophet Muhammad maintained the highest standard in this respect. ‘A’ishah says, ‘By God! I have never found anybody better than the women of the Ansar when it comes to honouring the Book of God and having faith in its instructions.’ When the following verse of the chapter entitled al-Nur, ‘They should put shawls over their bosoms’, was revealed, the Ansar men returned to their houses and conveyed to their wives, daughters and sisters the instructions revealed for them by God. Some untied their waist-belts while others used their covering sheets and made shawls out of them. The next morning when they offered prayers (salat) led by the Prophet Muhammad, it seemed as if crows sat on their heads (because of the scarves they wore). (Tafsir ibn Kathir, vol.

In the period when Islam came into existence, the system of owning slaves was prevalent in Arabia and, indeed, throughout the whole world. Islam, following its basic principles, started abolishing slavery in a very systematic though gradual manner. One of the methods followed was known as makatibah. The literal meaning of kitab or makatibah is ‘writing’. Here this term denotes a bond by which a male or female slave promises his or her owner to earn for him a specified amount within stipulated time, after which he or she will be free. Both male and female slaves were thus being set free either by makatibah or by other methods, so much so, that by the end of the period of early Islamic history (the period of the ‘four rightly guided caliphs’) the institution of slavery had been almost completely abolished. In pre-Islamic times and even in the very early period of Islam, there were people who used to make their slave girls work as prostitutes. Abdullah ibn Ubayy had many slave girls whom he forced into prostitution and thus earned a profit out of them. When one of these slave girls embraced Islam and wanted to give up prostitution, Abdullah ibn Ubayy started harassing her. Ultimately, at the behest of the Prophet Muhammad, she was freed from his clutches by paying for her freedom.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">This is a metaphor with many layers of meaning. ‘Light’ symbolizes the guidance of God Almighty. ‘Niche’ is man’s heart and ‘lamp’ is faith (iman), sheltered in that niche. The image is elaborated by two more points of reference: ‘crystal of star-like brilliance’ and ‘luminous oil’. Faith, already compared to a ‘lamp’ standing in the ‘niche’ of the human heart, is safe and well protected from any external influence by the ‘crystal’ or the walls of the niche (human heart). The ‘luminous oil’ filling the lamp and ready to be lit at any moment, speaks of the eagerness with which faith waits for the Truth to appear before it, so that it may accept it without the slightest delay and sets itself ablaze. The fact is that the only source of light in this universe is God. All receive light and guidance from this source alone. Furthermore, God instilled an intense longing for the Truth in the very nature of man. This desire is very strong and, if not diluted, constantly demands gratification. By nature, man’s receptivity to Truth is so immense and inflames so easily that it may be compared to petrol, which flares up as soon as a spark comes in contact with it. A seeker is one who has not let his natural instincts become impaired, so that, the moment he hears the genuine call for the acceptance of Truth, his instincts are aroused. The light of guidance coupled with the light of nature then illuminates his entire existence.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">In some of the preceding verses certain instructions regarding social behaviour are given. Now these verses were revealed, perhaps as a supplement to and an elaboration of them. For instance, one of the instructions given initially to women regarding the covering of the body was that they should cover their bosoms with scarves or sheets (verse 31). In verse 60 those old women who are past the marriageable age have been exempted from the general rule, and it is laid down that there is no harm in their not following it. These two sets of instructions could have been revealed at one and the same time, but there are four intervening paragraphs (ruku‘), in which different subjects have been dealt with. It is gathered from traditions that after the initial instructions had been revealed, some practical problems arose. Therefore, in clarification, these later verses were revealed.

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">Before the advent of Islam, Arab society enjoyed total freedom. Thereafter, however, Islam imposed some restrictions on entry into houses, as mentioned above. People thereupon felt that because of these restrictions, their social lives would become very constrained. These verses were then revealed to clarify matters. It was made clear that the restrictions were meant to regulate and systematize social life and not to curtail legitimate freedom. For instance, if the blind, the lame and the sick were isolated from attendants, relatives, etc., it would amount to making them physically helpless. But this was never the intention of Islam. So, leeway has been made in the earlier provisions and their true spirit has been indicated. It is stated that Islam’s real purpose is that people should be each other’s true well-wishers. When a man enters another’s house, he should make a salutation, saying: ‘Peace be on you and His (God’s) blessings be showered on you.’ If people are imbued with this spirit, most social evils will automatically cease.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">Circumstances often merit holding consultations on common issues to seek co-operation collectively. At such times, it may happen that certain people lose interest after a while and want to leave. This is not the correct Islamic attitude. However, even among those who are free of this attitude, there may be some who, because of some urgent need, want to leave the gathering before time. These persons must take proper permission from the responsible person (and during the period of the Prophet, it had to be taken from the Prophet himself). Furthermore, if the responsible person does not give them permission, they must ungrudgingly remain till the end of the proceedings. One who is responsible for the collective affairs of Muslims should possess the temperament and attitude to willingly accede to any request to be excused made on the plea of having something more urgent to attend to. He should pray for the one making such a request to be helped by God Almighty.</p>"
