But, running parallel with, or connecting to each highway, there are always many lanes and by-ways. If the traveller chooses to drive along one of the latter, thinking he is on the right road, he will never reach his destination, but will stray many miles to the right or left of it. The same is true of reaching God. God has already shown man which way will lead to Him. This is the way of the Unity of God (tawhid) and the fear of God (taqwa). One who follows this path will reach God and one who goes another way will be lost by the wayside; he will never be able to reach his Lord. Everything in the world treads the path fixed by God. Had God so wished, man also would have been compelled to follow the path fixed by God. But the scheme of the creation of man is different from that of the creation of other things. Other things are required only to follow a regulatory discipline. But in the case of man, what is required is voluntary obedience to this discipline. The result of there being this opportunity to voluntarily submit to regulation is that while one person will take the right path, another will leave it and become lost on paths of his own devising.</p>"

But if the iron is moulded in the shape of a ship, it will start floating on the surface and will be capable of carrying heavy loads and going from one country to another. This is a special law of God by means of which He has made as huge a creation as the sea subservient to man’s interests. Similarly, by a wonderful under-sea arrangement, fresh food is provided in the shape of fish and, for the ornamentation of man, valuable pearls are formed in the oysters which live in the ocean. As for the disposition of the world’s natural features, God could have made various other arrangements. For example, there might have been no oceans or seas on the earth; or man could have been made capable of walking on the sea as he walks on land. But this was not God’s way. His purpose was to create in man a feeling of gratefulness. Not being able to walk on the sea, when a man boards a boat or a ship, he experiences a sense of gratefulness; he thinks that since he is unable to traverse the sea with the help of his legs, God has been kind enough to make it traversable by means of a boat or a ship; he again thinks that since he is not able to fly in space, God has created such conditions as now permit him to fly at great speed in an aeroplane. Such divine preferences have been built into the system of nature in order to awaken man’s consciousness and to create in him feelings of gratefulness and obligation towards his Lord, the Sustainer.</p>"

There is proof of unity in the first occurrence and the second one shows symbolically that for human souls also, there is similar godly ‘rain’, and that is ‘revelation’.

If man reflects deeply upon these phenomena, he will feel as if he is seeing God in action in His universe; he will discover the Creator in the creative system; he will see the glory of the Manufacturer in the artefacts. At the human level, take the house. The house is a shelter and a resting place for man. But how is a house built? There are many arrangements of God—thanks to which the construction of a house on earth is possible. All the elements by means of which a house is built have been placed in advance in our world. The earth has exactly the right gravitational force, thanks to which houses stay stable on the surface of the earth—otherwise they would have flown away from the earth, which is moving at a speed of one thousand miles per hour. Then there are things like the hides of animals from which man makes tents and basic crops such as cotton and flax from which fabrics can be made to decorate and protect the human body in the changing seasons. All such things are provided so that man should develop a deep feeling gratitude for his Lord and Sustainer; and for the bounties granted by Him, he should fall down on his knees before God in the full realization of His Majesty and Powers.</p>"

The result of the sun’s heat being so well regulated is that an ordinary barrier gives us comfortable shade. Had the sun’s heat been more than at present, which is quite possible, our shaded dwellings would have become burning hot ovens. There being caves in hard rocks where man can make his dwellings and there being such materials in the world which, made into thin fibres provide clothes for the protection of man’s body, are very important factors for a creature like a human being, so much so that if they had not been available, there would have been no human beings and no human civilization on the earth. This realization develops two kinds of feelings in man—firstly, the feeling of obligation towards God, because He is the one who has given to man such valuable bounties and, secondly, a feeling of fear, because if God were to take away these bounties, man would have no other recourse. If such feelings awaken man’s inner self to such an extent that he spontaneously kneels down before his Lord, then this is indeed true worship (la‘allakum tuslimun).</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">How a subject of God should live in the world has been clearly described in this verse. In view of its importance, Caliph ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul ‘Aziz included this verse in the weekly sermon. The first thing an individual must ensure is that justice (‘adal) is done. This means that whatever right one person has over another should be fully discharged, be the claimant weak or strong. In the fulfillment of rights, only the nature of the right will be considered and not any other factors. The next thing is showing consideration (ihsan). This means that while honouring rights, one should be broadminded. Human consideration should be added to the demands of justice. One should exhibit generosity and sympathy beyond the legal requirement. Man should have the courage as far as possible to reconcile with whatever is rightfully due to him and try to give to others more than is rightfully their due. The third thing is ‘giving their due to near relatives’ (wa i’ta zil qurba). This means that just as a man becomes anxious when he sees his wife and children in need and fulfills that need, he should be similarly sensitive about the needs of others who are close to him. No well-to-do person should behave as if only he himself and the members of his household are entitled to his property: he should also include in his responsibilities the fulfillment of the rights of his relatives. After this three things have been prohibited in this verse. The first thing is moral evil (fahsha’) which is clearly judged to be such by the human conscience and universally considered shameful. The second is the perpetration of such deeds as are judged improper by common moral standards. This includes all those things which are considered as evil by man and which man’s nature refuses to accept. Munkar is the opposite of ma‘ruf. Ma‘ruf consists of such things as are considered good in every society. The third thing is transgressing all limits (baghi). This includes arrogance when a man exceeds his recognized limit and attacks another person; his engaging in sinful behaviour in order to harm another’s life, property and honour; his making use of his strength and influence to gain an illegitimate advantage.</p>"

If someone spins cotton, working hard the whole day, but in the evening tears the spun thread to pieces, then the entire hard work will go waste. The same is true of those who enter into a mutual agreement and one or the other party breaks it without any valid reason. Shredding the cotton thread after spinning it amounts to wasting one’s labour. Similarly, the breaking of an executed agreement nullifies the whole process by which a matter of mutual unity had come into existence. In the present world a man spends his life along with other human beings. Every man has to do his work among many other men. For this reason, great importance is given to mutual confidence and trust. In order to maintain this collective social life, agreements and decisions between one man and another man are frequently entered into, sometimes by oath and sometimes without an oath. Now, if people start breaking such agreements without any real justification, social life will be greatly disturbed and constructive development of any kind will no longer be possible. There are two ways of making an agreement in the name of God. In one case a pledge is made formally, uttering the words of the oath. In the second case the words of the oath are not uttered, but reference to God in some form is included in the agreement executed. In all such cases the undertakers of oaths are as if making God the witness or surety in the matter. The breaking of an agreement in which the name of God is also included is much more serious, because this shows that it is only when a man needs to win the confidence of others that he makes use of God’s name, but when he is overcome by the requirements of his own interests, he ignores God. There are two types of agreements between individuals or communities—one is based on principles, and the other is based on interest. In ancient times, the position was that whenever there appeared to be any advantage in making  such an agreement, it was executed, but whenever it seemed beneficial to break it, it was broken. Things are no different today. As opposed to this, Islam requires that agreements should be subject to the principles of Islamic law and morality.</p>"

The Jews celebrate it on Saturday (the Sabbath), the Christians on Sunday and Muslims have been given orders to arrange for it on Friday. The leading lights among the ancient Jews did some hair-splitting and devised new regulations for the Sabbath. In this way, they bound themselves by artificial restrictions. Thereafter, when they found it impossible to follow those restrictions, they could not reject them in consideration of the holiness of their great men. But, in practice, they started going against these restrictions. The differences created in God’s religion by later scholars and other luminaries by means of their commentaries are not going to be resolved in the world, but when the Day of Judgement comes, God will then show what the real religion of God was and what the things were that the people themselves added to and included in their religion.</p>"

However there are always those addressees who indulge in pointless discussions with the intention, who have no desire to understand the message but they only want to complicate matters. In such a case, the preacher must respond with gentleness; in the face of harsh words he must resort to reasoning and analysis and, in response to provocation, he must exercise patience. The eye of one who calls on others to the Truth is not on his audience but on God, who transcends all. Therefore, he utters such statements as prove to be true in God’s eyes rather than in man’s assessment.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">This verse indicates the character traits to be displayed by the dayee while facing up to his opponents. However, God says that if he is too sorely afflicted—allowing for human weakness in him as in other mortals, he is permitted to repay his tormentors in kind. But strictly speaking, the dayee is supposed to exercise patience whenever his addressees create trouble for him. Instead of adopting a retaliatory approach, he should leave all such issues to God. If the addressee does not accept the Truth, being bent rather on destroying the dayee and his mission, then the best course to be adopted by him is that of patience, i.e. avoiding reaction or retaliatory actions, he should continue conveying the message of Truth in a positive manner. The missionary has really to prove that, in fact, he is always conscious of God. If he proves this, then thereafter in all other matters, God becomes sufficient for him. After that no device of his opponents can harm him. However, strong his opponents may be. There are two kinds of human beings in this world. One is entirely focused on man and his activities, while the other is entirely focused on God. The latter see the powers of God with their own eyes. The former is never able to have control over impatience and anger. It is only the second type of person who can bear complaints and suffer bitterness and, for the sake of whatever he is going to receive from God, ignore whatever is meted out to him by his fellow men. The dayee must not have a vengeful mentality, and must abstain from retaliatory action. The conspiracies and devices of his opponents are likely to make him afraid that they may completely derail the call of Truth and destroy the preacher himself. But whatever the circumstances, he has to rely on God; he is required to have the firm belief that God sees everything and that He will support the Truth and defeat the falsehood.</p>"
