So after Ḥafṣah informed ‘Ā’ishah of the information, and Allah informed His Messenger of his secret having been spread, he reprimanded Ḥafṣah and told her part of what she had said, not mentioning another. So she asked him, “Who informed you of this?” He replied, “The Knower of everything and The Aware of every hidden thing informed me of it.”"

And if you insist upon joining forces against him, then know that Allah is his guardian and helper, and so is Gabriel and the best of believers. The angels are also his helpers and supporters after Allah against those who cause inconvenience to him."

However, he did not divorce them."

Rather, their light will shine in front of them and their right sides on the Bridge, and they will be saying: “O our Lord! Perfect for us our light so that we can enter Paradise and not be like the hypocrites whose light dies out at the Bridge; and forgive our sins for us, because You are indeed, capable of everything. You are not incapable of perfecting our light and forgiving our sins.”"

For verily they were wives to two pious servants, but they deceived their husbands by preventing from the path of Allah and helping the people of disbelief from their nations. Their being wives of these two pious servants did not help them, and it will be said to them: “Enter into the hellfire amongst the disbelievers and transgressors entering it.”"

She also believed in the religions of Allah and the books revealed to His Messengers, and she was obedient to Allah by fulfilling His commands and refraining from the things He did not allow."
