It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that they will be standing for forty years with their heads raised toward the sky. No one will speak to them, and the righteous and wicked among them will all be bridled in sweat. It has been reported from Ibn `Umar that they will be standing for one hundred years. Both of these statements have been recorded by Ibn Jarir. In the Sunans of Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, it is recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah used to begin his late night prayer by declaring Allah's greatness ten times, praising Allah ten times, glorifying Allah ten times, and seeking Allah's forgiveness ten times.

Thus, they consider it a matter that is farfetched. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُكَذِّبُ بِهِ إِلاَّ كُلُّ مُعْتَدٍ أَثِيمٍ </div><p>(And none can deny it except every transgressor, sinner.) meaning, transgressive in his actions by doing that which is forbidden and exceeding the limits when acquiring the permissible. He is a sinner in his statements, because he lies whenever he speaks, he breaks his promises whenever he makes them, and he behaves in an abusive and wicked manner whenever he argues. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالَ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: \"Tales of the ancients!\") meaning, whenever he hears the Words of Allah from the Messenger , he denies it and has ill thoughts about it.

But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.) meaning, the matter is not as they claim, nor as they say: \"Verily, this Qur'an is tales of the ancients.\" Rather, it is the Word of Allah, His inspiration and His revelation to His Messenger . The only thing that blocked their hearts from believing in it is the dark covering cast over it from the many sins and wrong they committed that has covered up their hearts.

Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Those nearest to Allah in each heaven will witness it.\" Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الاٌّبْرَارَ لَفِى نَعِيمٍ </div><p>(Verily, Al-Abrar (the righteuos believers) will be in Delight.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement they will be in eternal pleasure and gardens that contain comprehensive bounties.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى الاٌّرَائِكِ</div><p>(On thrones,) These are thrones beneath canopies from which they will be gazing. It has been said, \"This means that they will be gazing at their kingdom and what Allah has given them of good and bounties that will not end or perish. It has also been said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى الاٌّرَآئِكِ يَنظُرُونَ </div><p>(On thrones, looking.) \"This means that they will be looking at Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.\" This is the opposite of what those wicked people have been described with,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ </div><p>(Nay! Surely, they (evildoers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.) (83:15) Thus, it has been mentioned that these (righteous people) will be allowed to look at Allah while they are upon their thrones and elevated couches. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَعْرِفُ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ </div><p>(You will recognize in their faces the brightness of delight.) meaning, `you will notice a glow of delight in their faces when you look at them.' This is a description of opulence, decorum, happiness, composure, and authority that they will be experiencing from this great delight. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُسْقَوْنَ مِن رَّحِيقٍ مَّخْتُومٍ </div><p>(They will be given to drink of pure sealed Rahiq.) meaning, they will be given drink from the wine of Paradise. Ar-Rahiq is one of the names of the wine (in Paradise). Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd all said this. Ibn Mas`ud said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خِتَـمُهُ مِسْكٌ</div><p>(Sealed with musk,) \"This means it will be mixed with musk.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Allah will make the wine have a pleasant aroma for them, so the last thing that He will place in it will be musk. Thus, it will be sealed with musk.\" Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak both said the same. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى ذَلِكَ فَلْيَتَنَافَسِ الْمُتَنَـفِسُونَ</div><p>(and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive.) meaning, for a situation like this, let the boasters boast, compete, and strive to gain more. Let the competitors compete and race toward the likes of this. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِمِثْلِ هَـذَا فَلْيَعْمَلِ الْعَـمِلُونَ </div><p>(For the like of this let the workers work.) (37:61) Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِزَاجُهُ مِن تَسْنِيمٍ </div><p>(It will be mixed with Tasnim.) meaning, this wine that is being described is mixed with Tasnim. This refers to a drink called Tasnim, and it is the most excellent and exalted drink of the people of Paradise. This was said by Abu Salih and Ad-Dahhak. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَيْناً يَشْرَبُ بِهَا الْمُقَرَّبُونَ </div><p>(A spring whereof drink those nearest to Allah.) (83:28) meaning, those who are near to Allah, will drink from it as they wish, and the companions of the right hand will be given a drink that is mixed with it. This has been said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Qatadah and others.</p>"
