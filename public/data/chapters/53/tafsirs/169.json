      "text": "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad brought to people was taught to him by,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</div><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ </div><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذُو مِرَّةٍ</div><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed.

So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it.

We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

      "text": "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad brought to people was taught to him by,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</div><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ </div><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذُو مِرَّةٍ</div><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw.

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.)

We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw.

Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.)

Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!)

Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it.

Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.)

Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration.

Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw.

Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</div><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَوَى</div><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى </div><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَدْنَى</div><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it.

Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى </div><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</div><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ </div><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى </div><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</div><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</div><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</div><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</div><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</div><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</div><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</div><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ </div><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى </div><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger about it. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</div><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى </div><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا طَغَى</div><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>"

They built houses for their idols to resemble the Ka`bah built by Prophet Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ</div><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat,) Al-Lat was a white stone with inscriptions on. There was a house built around Al-Lat in At-Ta'if with curtains, servants and a sacred courtyard around it. The people of At-Ta'if, the tribe of Thaqif and their allies, worshipped Al-Lat. They would boast to Arabs, except the Quraysh, that they had Al-Lat. Ibn Jarir said, \"They derived Al-Lat's name from Allah's Name, and made it feminine. Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. It was reported that Al-Lat is pronounced Al-Lat because, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq (a kind of barley mash) with water for the pilgrims during the time of Jahiliyyah. When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى</div><p>(Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.) \"Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq for the pilgrims.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"They also derived the name for their idol Al-`Uzza from Allah's Name Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered Al-`Uzza.\" During the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan said, \"We have Al-`Uzza, but you do not have Al-`Uzza.\" Allah's Messenger replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.\") Manat was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere Manat during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to announce Hajj to the Ka`bah from next to Manat. Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ارْجِعْ فَإِنَّكَ لَمْ تَصْنَعْ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.) Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى»</div><p>(That was Al-`Uzza!)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, \"Al-Lat belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of Al-Lat and its servants.\" I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy Al-Lat. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى </div><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.

However, they did not adhere to or follow the guidance that came to them through the Prophets.</p><h2>Wishful Thinking does not earn One Righteousness</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ لِلإِنسَـنِ مَا تَمَنَّى </div><p>(Or shall man have what he wishes), asserting that not everyone gets the goodness that he wishes,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(It will not be in accordance with desires (of Muslims), nor those of the People of Scripture.)(4:123) Allah says, not everyone who claims to be guided is truly guided, and not everyone gets what he wishes for himself. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا تَمَنَّى أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَنْظُرْ مَا يَتَمَنَّى، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَدْرِي مَا يُكْتَبُ لَهُ مِنْ أُمْنِيَّتِه»</div><p>(When one of you wishes for something, let him be careful with what he wishes for, because he does not know what part of his wish will be written for him.)Only Ahmad collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلِلَّهِ الاٌّخِرَةُ والاٍّولَى </div><p>(But to Allah belongs the last and the first.) meaning, all matters belong to Allah and He is the King and Owner of this world and the Hereafter, Who does what He will in both lives. Whatever He wills, occurs and whatever He does not will, never occurs.</p><h2>No Interecession except with Allah's Leave</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى </div><p>(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.)

Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest.

They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it.

Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning.

Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it.

I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam.

      "text": "<h2>Refuting Idolatry, Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza</h2><p>Allah the Exalted rebukes the idolators for worshipping idols and taking rivals to Him. They built houses for their idols to resemble the Ka`bah built by Prophet Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ</div><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat,) Al-Lat was a white stone with inscriptions on. There was a house built around Al-Lat in At-Ta'if with curtains, servants and a sacred courtyard around it. The people of At-Ta'if, the tribe of Thaqif and their allies, worshipped Al-Lat. They would boast to Arabs, except the Quraysh, that they had Al-Lat. Ibn Jarir said, \"They derived Al-Lat's name from Allah's Name, and made it feminine. Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. It was reported that Al-Lat is pronounced Al-Lat because, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq (a kind of barley mash) with water for the pilgrims during the time of Jahiliyyah. When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى</div><p>(Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.) \"Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq for the pilgrims.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"They also derived the name for their idol Al-`Uzza from Allah's Name Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered Al-`Uzza.\" During the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan said, \"We have Al-`Uzza, but you do not have Al-`Uzza.\" Allah's Messenger replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</div><p>(Say, \"Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.\") Manat was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere Manat during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to announce Hajj to the Ka`bah from next to Manat. Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ارْجِعْ فَإِنَّكَ لَمْ تَصْنَعْ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.) Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى»</div><p>(That was Al-`Uzza!)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, \"Al-Lat belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of Al-Lat and its servants.\" I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy Al-Lat. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى </div><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.

Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</div><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled.

Therefore, he is worthy of being made a leader for mankind in all of his affairs, statements and actions. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.\")(16:123)</p><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَزِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى </div><p>(That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</div><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى </div><p>(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا مَاتَ الْإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِه»</div><p>(When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَطْيَبَ مَا أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِهِ، وَإِنَّ وَلَدَهُ مِنْ كَسْبِه»</div><p>(Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.)

Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</div><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled.

Therefore, he is worthy of being made a leader for mankind in all of his affairs, statements and actions. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.\")(16:123)</p><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَزِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى </div><p>(That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</div><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى </div><p>(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا مَاتَ الْإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِه»</div><p>(When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَطْيَبَ مَا أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِهِ، وَإِنَّ وَلَدَهُ مِنْ كَسْبِه»</div><p>(Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى </div><p>(And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلِ اعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(And say: \"Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.\")(9:105), Then Allah will remind you of your actions and recompense you for them in the best manner, good for good and evil for evil.
