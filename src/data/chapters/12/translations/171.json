As Allah planned things for Joseph by arranging to have the bowl put into the bag of his brother, He also arranged – for the benefit of Joseph – that his brothers would be given the punishment of their country, which was the enslavement of the thief. This would not have come to pass if it had been according to the punishment of the king for thieves, which was beating and fining. Allah is able to arrange matters in whatever way He wills. He raises the ranks of those of His servants whom He wills, as He raised the rank of Joseph.
