In this Ayah, Allah describes darkness in the plural, Zulumat where Zulmah is singular for darkness, while describing the light in the singular, An-Nur, because An-Nur is more honored. In other Ayat, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ</div><p>(To the right and to the lefts.) 16:48 Near the end of this Surah (chapter 6), Allah also said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</div><p>(And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow no (other) ways, for they will separate you away from His way.) 6:153 Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثْمَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</div><p>(Yet those who disbelieve hold others as equal with their Lord.) meaning, in spite of all this, some of Allah's servants disbelieve in Him and hold others as partners and rivals with Him.

Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَا لَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّكُمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen how many a generation before them We have destroyed whom We had established on the earth such as We have not established you) meaning, they had more wealth, children, buildings, abundant provision, riches and soldiers. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ عَلَيْهِم مَّدْرَاراً</div><p>(and We poured out on them rain from the sky in abundance, ) in reference to rain that comes often, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا الاٌّنْهَـرَ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهِمْ</div><p>(And made the rivers flow under them.) as rain was abundant and the springs were plentiful, so that We deceived them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ</div><p>(Yet We destroyed them for their sins) meaning the mistakes and errors that they committed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنْشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْناً ءَاخَرِينَ</div><p>(and created after them other generations,) for, these generations of old perished and became as legends and stories, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنْشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْناً ءَاخَرِينَ</div><p>(And created after them other generations.) so that We test the new generations, as well. Yet, they committed similar errors and were destroyed, as their ancestors were destroyed. Therefore, beware of the same end that might befall you, for you are not dearer to Allah than these previous nations, but the Messenger whom you defied is dearer to Allah than the Messengers they defied. Thus, you are more liable than them to receive torment, if it was not for Allah's mercy and kindness. </p>"

In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْمُؤمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ</div><p>(Indeed Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses (the Qur'an), and purifying them.) 3:164 Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah 6:9 above, \"If an angel was sent to them, he would come in the shape of a man.

This is because they received good news from the previous Messengers and Prophets about the coming of Muhammad , his attributes, homeland, his migration, and the description of his Ummah. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُم</div><p>(Those who have lost (destroyed) themselves) and thus incurred the ultimate loss, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(will not believe.) in this clear matter. A matter about which the previous Prophets gave good news, and a matter extolled about in ancient and modern times. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَايَـتِهِ</div><p>(And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat) meaning, there is no person more unjust than he who lies about Allah and claims that Allah has sent him, while Allah did not send him. There is no person more unjust than he who denies Allah's proofs, signs and evidences, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(Verily, the wrongdoers shall never be successful.) Surely, both of these people will never acquire success, whoever falsely claims that Allah sent him and whoever refuses Allah's Ayat. </p>"

So they listened to the Prophet's recitation until the morning, and then left. They met each other on their way back and each one of them asked the others, \"What brought you\" So they mentioned to each other the reason why they came. They vowed not to repeat this incident so that the young men of Quraysh would not hear of what they did and imitate them. On the second night, each one of the three came back thinking that the other two would not come because of the vows they made to each other. In the morning, they again met each other on their way back and criticized each other, vowing not to repeat what they did. On the third night, they again went to listen to the Prophet and in the morning they again vowed not to repeat this incident. During that day, Al-Akhnas bin Shurayq took his staff and went to Abu Sufyan bin Harb in his house saying, \"O Abu Hanzalah! What is your opinion concerning what you heard from Muhammad.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"O Abu Tha`labah! By Allah, I have heard some things that I recognize and know their implications. I also heard some things whose meaning and implications were unknown to me.\" Al-Akhnas said, \"And I the same, by He Whom you swore by!\" Al-Akhnas left Abu Sufyan and went to Abu Jahl and asked him, \"O Abu Al-Hakam! What is your opinion about what you heard from Muhammad. \" Abu Jahl said, \"We competed with Bani `Abd Manaf (the Prophet's subtribe) and so we fed as they fed and gave away as they gave away. So, when we were neck and neck with them, just as two horses in a race, they said, `There is a Prophet from among us, to whom revelation from the heaven comes.' So how can we ever beat them at that By Allah we will never believe in him or accept what he says.'

He also promised him victory, just as the previous Messengers were victorious and the good end was theirs, after the denial and harm their people placed on them.

Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned that Az-Zuhri said that Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and Al-Akhnas bin Shurayq once came to listen to the Prophet reciting the Qur'an at night, but these three men were not aware of the presence of each other. So they listened to the Prophet's recitation until the morning, and then left. They met each other on their way back and each one of them asked the others, \"What brought you\" So they mentioned to each other the reason why they came. They vowed not to repeat this incident so that the young men of Quraysh would not hear of what they did and imitate them. On the second night, each one of the three came back thinking that the other two would not come because of the vows they made to each other. In the morning, they again met each other on their way back and criticized each other, vowing not to repeat what they did. On the third night, they again went to listen to the Prophet and in the morning they again vowed not to repeat this incident. During that day, Al-Akhnas bin Shurayq took his staff and went to Abu Sufyan bin Harb in his house saying, \"O Abu Hanzalah! What is your opinion concerning what you heard from Muhammad.\" Abu Sufyan said, \"O Abu Tha`labah! By Allah, I have heard some things that I recognize and know their implications. I also heard some things whose meaning and implications were unknown to me.\" Al-Akhnas said, \"And I the same, by He Whom you swore by!\" Al-Akhnas left Abu Sufyan and went to Abu Jahl and asked him, \"O Abu Al-Hakam! What is your opinion about what you heard from Muhammad. \" Abu Jahl said, \"We competed with Bani `Abd Manaf (the Prophet's subtribe) and so we fed as they fed and gave away as they gave away. So, when we were neck and neck with them, just as two horses in a race, they said, `There is a Prophet from among us, to whom revelation from the heaven comes.' So how can we ever beat them at that By Allah we will never believe in him or accept what he says.'

He also promised him victory, just as the previous Messengers were victorious and the good end was theirs, after the denial and harm their people placed on them.

He is the One Who has no partners, Who accepts the supplication from whomever He wills. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُكُم إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمْ السَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"Tell me if Allah's torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allah (Reply) if you are truthful!\") This means, you -- disbelievers -- will not call other than Allah in this case, because you know that none except He is able to remove the affliction. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(if you are truthful) by taking gods besides Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ إِيَّـهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Nay! To Him alone you call, and, if He willed, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you forget at that time whatever partners you joined with Him (in worship)!) for in times of necessity, you only call on Allah and forget your idols and false deities. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ</div><p>(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah)) 17:67.

I looked up and saw Jibril in it and he called me saying, `Indeed Allah has heard what you said to the people and what they have responded to you. Therefore, Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, `O Muhammad! verily, Allah has heard how your people responded to you and He has sent me to you so that you could order me to do what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akhshabayn (two mountains to the north and south of Makkah) fall on them.' The Prophet said, No, but I hope that Allah will let them generate offspring who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship none besides Him.) This is the wording of Muslim. Tormenting the disbelievers of Quraysh was offered to the Prophet , but he chose patience and asked Allah for respite for them, so that Allah might let them generate offspring who will not associate anything with Him in worship. Therefore, how can we combine the meaning of this Hadith and the honorable Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لَّوْ أَنَّ عِندِى مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ لَقُضِىَ الاٌّمْرُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِالظَّـلِمِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If I had that which you are asking for impatiently (the torment), the matter would have been settled at once between you and I, but Allah knows best the wrongdoers.\") The answer to this question is, Allah knows the best, that the Ayah states that if the punishment that they asked for was in the Prophet's hand at the time, he would have sent it on them as they asked. As for the Hadith, the disbelievers did not ask the Prophet to send the torment down on them. Rather, the angel responsible for the mountains offered him the choice to let the two mountains to the north and south of Makkah close in on the disbelievers and crush them. The Prophet did not wish that and asked for respite out of compassion for them. </p><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He.)

I looked up and saw Jibril in it and he called me saying, `Indeed Allah has heard what you said to the people and what they have responded to you. Therefore, Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, `O Muhammad! verily, Allah has heard how your people responded to you and He has sent me to you so that you could order me to do what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akhshabayn (two mountains to the north and south of Makkah) fall on them.' The Prophet said, No, but I hope that Allah will let them generate offspring who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship none besides Him.) This is the wording of Muslim. Tormenting the disbelievers of Quraysh was offered to the Prophet , but he chose patience and asked Allah for respite for them, so that Allah might let them generate offspring who will not associate anything with Him in worship.

As for the Hadith, the disbelievers did not ask the Prophet to send the torment down on them. Rather, the angel responsible for the mountains offered him the choice to let the two mountains to the north and south of Makkah close in on the disbelievers and crush them.

If he is a righteous person, the angels will say, `O pure soul from a pure body! Come out with honor and receive the good news of rest, satisfaction and a Lord Who is not angry.' The angels will keep saying this until the soul leaves its body, and they will then raise it up to heaven and will ask that the door be opened for the soul and it will be asked, `Who is this' It will be said, `(The soul of) so-and-so.' It will be said, `Welcome, to the pure soul that inhabited the pure body. Enter with honor and receive the good news of rest, satisfaction and a Lord Who is not angry.' This statement will be repeated until the soul reaches the heaven above which there is Allah. If the dying person is evil, the angels will say, `Get out (of your body), O wicked soul from a wicked body! Get out in disgrace and receive the news of boiling fluid, a fluid dark, murky, intensely cold and other (torments) of similar kind - all together - to match them.' This statement will be said repeatedly until the evil soul leaves its body. The soul will be raised up to heaven and a request will be made that the door be opened for it. It will be asked, `Who is this' It will be said, `(The soul of) so and so.' It will be said, `No welcome to the wicked soul from the wicked body. Return with disgrace, for the doors of heaven will not be opened for you.' So it will be thrown from heaven until it returns to the grave. So the righteous person sits and similar is said to him as before. And the evil person sits and similar is said to him as before.) It is also possible that the meaning of, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ</div><p>(Then they are returned...) refers to the return of all creation to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, when He will subject them to His just decision.

In other Ayat, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ</div><p>(And when harm strikes you at sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him.) 17:67, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى يُسَيِّرُكُمْ فِى الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ حَتَّى إِذَا كُنتُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ وَجَرَيْنَ بِهِم بِرِيحٍ طَيِّبَةٍ وَفَرِحُواْ بِهَا جَآءَتْهَا رِيحٌ عَاصِفٌ وَجَآءَهُمُ الْمَوْجُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ أُحِيطَ بِهِمْ دَعَوُاْ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ لَئِنْ أَنْجَيْتَنَا مِنْ هَـذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّـكِرِينَ </div><p>(He it is Who enables you to travel through the land and the sea, till when you are in the ships and they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they rejoice, then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are encircled therein, they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him alone, saying: \"If You deliver us from this, we shall truly be of the grateful\".) 10:22, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّن يَهْدِيكُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ وَمَن يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرًاَ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ أَءِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى اللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy Is there any god with Allah High Exalted be Allah above all that they associate as partners (with Him)!) 27:63. Allah said in this honorable Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّن ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعاً وَخُفْيَةً</div><p>(Say: \"Who rescues you from the dark recesses of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him begging and in secret.\") i.e., in public and secret, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّئِنْ أَنجَـنَا</div><p>((Saying): `If He (Allah) only saves us...) from this distress, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّـكِرِينَ</div><p>(we shall truly be grateful.) thereafter. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلِ اللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Say: \"Allah rescues you from these (dangers) and from all distress, and yet you commit Shirk.\") meaning, yet you call other gods besides Him in times of comfort. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَى أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ</div><p>(Say: \"He has the power to send torment on you from above or from under your feet,\") He said this after His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(And yet you commit Shirk. ) Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَى أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً</div><p>(Say: \"He has the power to send torment on you..\"), after He saves you. Allah said in Surah Subhan (chapter 17), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَّبُّكُمُ الَّذِى يُزْجِى لَكُمُ الْفُلْكَ فِى الْبَحْرِ لِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا - وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا نَجَّـكُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ وَكَانَ الإِنْسَـنُ كَفُورًا - أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ الْبَرِّ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِبًا ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ وَكِيلاً - أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ أَن يُعِيدَكُمْ فِيهِ تَارَةً أُخْرَى فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفًا مِّنَ الرِّيحِ فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا </div><p>(Your Lord is He Who drives the ship for you through the sea, in order that you may seek of His bounty. Truly! He is Ever Merciful towards you. And when harm strikes you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him. But when He brings you safely to land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ever ungrateful. Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up, or that He will not send against you a storm of stones Then, you shall find no guardian. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea, and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you because of your disbelief, then you will not find any avenger therein against Us) 17:66-69. Al-Bukhari, may Allah grant him His mercy, commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَى أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعاً وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ </div><p>(Say: \"He has the power to send torment on you from above or from under your feet, or to Yalbisakum in party strife, and make you taste the violence of one another.\" See how variously We explain the Ayat, so that they may understand.) \"Yalbisakum means, `cover you with confusion', So it means to, `divide into parties and sects'. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, `When this Ayah was revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هُوَ الْقَادِرُ عَلَى أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ</div><p>(Say: \"He has power to send torment on you from above\") Allah's Messenger said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَعُوذُ بِوَجْهِك»</div><p>(I seek refuge with Your Face.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ</div><p>(or from under your feet,) he again said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَعُوذُ بِوَجْهِك»</div><p>(I seek refuge with Your Face.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعاً وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ</div><p>(or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.) he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَذهِ أَهْوَنُ أَوْ أَيْسَر»</div><p>(This is less burdensome or easier.)\"' Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith again in the book of Tawhid (in his Sahih), and An-Nasa'i also recorded it in the book of Tafsir. </p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas said, We accompanied the Messenger of Allah and passed by the Masjid of Bani Mu`awiyah. The Prophet went in and offered a two Rak`ah prayer, and we prayed behind him. He supplicated to his Lord for a long time and then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَأَلْتُ رَبِّي ثَلَاثًا: سَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ لَا يُهْلِكَ أُمَّتِي بِالْغَرَقِ فَأَعْطَانِيهَا، وَسَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ لَا يُهْلِكَ أُمَّتِي بِالسَّنَةِ فَأَعْطَانِيهَا، وَسَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ لَا يَجْعَلَ بَأْسَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ فَمَنَعَنِيهَا»</div><p>(I asked my Lord for three: I asked Him not to destroy my Ummah (Muslims) by drowning and He gave that to me. I asked Him not to destroy my Ummah by famine and He gave that to me. And I asked Him not to make them taste the violence of one another, but He did not give that to me.) Muslim, but not Al-Bukhari, recorded this Hadith in the book on Fitan (trials) (of his Sahih). </p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Khabbab bin Al-Aratt, who attended the battle of Badr with the Messenger of Allah , said, \"I met Allah's Messenger during a night in which he prayed throughout it, until dawn. When the Messenger of Allah ended his prayer, I said, `O Allah's Messenger! This night, you have performed a prayer that I never saw you perform before.' Allah's Messenger said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَجَلْ إِنَّهَا صَلَاةُ رَغَبٍ وَرَهَبٍ، سَأَلْتُ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِيهَا ثَلَاثَ خِصَالٍ، فَأَعْطَانِي اثْنَتَيْنِ وَمَنَعَنِي وَاحِدَةً، سَأَلْتُ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ لَا يُهْلِكْنَا بِمَا أَهْلَكَ بِهِ الْأُمَمَ قَبْلَنَا فَأَعْطَانِيهَا، وَسَأَلْتُ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ لَا يُظْهِرَ عَلَيْنَا عَدُوًّا مِنْ غَيْرِنَا فَأَعْطَانِيهَا، وَسَأَلْتُ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ لَا يُلْبِسَنَا شِيَعًا فَمَنَعَنِيهَا»</div><p>(Yes, it was a prayer of eagerness and fear. During this prayer, I asked my Lord for three things and He gave me two and refused to give me the third. I asked my Lord not to destroy us with what He destroyed the nations before us and He gave me that. I asked my Lord not to make our enemies prevail above us and He gave me that. I asked my Lord not to cover us with confusion in party strife, but He refused.) An-Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban in his Sahih, and At-Tirmidhi also recorded it. In the book on Fitan, in Al-Jami`, At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih\". Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعاً</div><p>(or to cover you with confusion in party strife, ) means, He causes you to be in disarray and separate into opposing parties and groups. Al-Walibi (`Ali bin Abi Talhah) reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this Ayah refers to desires. Mujahid and several others said similarly. A Hadith from the Prophet , collected from various chains of narration, states, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الأُمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَاثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، كُلُّهَا فِي النَّارِ إِلَّا وَاحِدَة»</div><p>(And this Ummah (Muslims) will divide into seventy - three groups, all of them in the Fire except one.) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ</div><p>(and make you taste the violence of one another.) meaning, some of you will esperience torture and murder from one another, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ الاٌّيَـتِ</div><p>(See how variously We explain the Ayat,) by making them clear, plain and duly explained, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ</div><p>(So that they may understand.) and comprehend Allah's Ayat, proofs and evidences. </p>"

This is the example of he who follows the devil after recognizing Muhammad , and Muhammad is the person who is calling the people to the path, and the path is Islam.\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement.Allah's statement, j </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Like one whom the Shayatin (devils) have made to go astray (wandering) through the land, ) refers to ghouls, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَدْعُونَهُ</div><p>(calling him) by his name, his father's and his grandfather's names. So he follows the devils' call thinking that it is a path of guidance, but by the morning he will find himself destroyed and perhaps they eat him. The Jinns will then let him wander in a wasteland where he will die of thirst. This is the example of those who follow the false gods that are being worshipped instead of Allah, Most Honored.

In the first case with his father, Ibrahim explained to his people their error in worshipping the idols of earth, which they made in the shape of heavenly angels, so that they intercede on their behalf with the Glorious Creator. His people thought that they are too insignificant to worship Allah directly, and this is why they turned to the worship of angels as intercessors with Allah for their provisions, gaining victory and attaining their various needs. He then explained to them the error and deviation of worshipping the seven planets, which they said were the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The brightest of these objects and the most honored to them was the Sun, the Moon then Venus. Ibrahim, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, first proved that Venus is not worthy of being worshipped, for it is subservient to a term and course appointed that it does not defy, nor swerving right or left. Venus does not have any say in its affairs, for it is only a heavenly object that Allah created and made bright out of His wisdom. Venus rises from the east and sets in the west where it disappears from sight. This rotation is repeated the next night, and so forth. Such an object is not worthy of being a god. Ibrahim then went on to mention the Moon in the same manner in which he mentioned Venus, and then the Sun. When he proved that these three objects were not gods, although they are the brightest objects the eyes can see, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يقَوْمِ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.\") meaning, I am free from worshipping these objects and from taking them as protectors. Therefore, if they are indeed gods as you claim, then all of you bring your plot against me and do not give me respite. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّذِى فَطَرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, Hanifan, and I am not one of the idolators.) meaning, I worship the Creator of these things, Who originated and decreed them, and Who governs their affairs and made them subservient. It is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of all things, and He is the Creator, Lord, King and God of all things in existence. In another Ayah, Allah said؛ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, and then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars, subjecting them to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54. Allah described Prophet Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَـلِمِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـذِهِ التَّمَـثِيلُ الَّتِى أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَـكِفُونَ </div><p>(And indeed We bestowed aforetime on Ibrahim his (portion of) guidance, and We were well-acquainted with him. When he said to his father and his people: \"What are these images, to which you are devoted\") 21:51-52. These Ayat indicate that Ibrahim was debating with his people about the Shirk they practiced. </p>"

In the first case with his father, Ibrahim explained to his people their error in worshipping the idols of earth, which they made in the shape of heavenly angels, so that they intercede on their behalf with the Glorious Creator. His people thought that they are too insignificant to worship Allah directly, and this is why they turned to the worship of angels as intercessors with Allah for their provisions, gaining victory and attaining their various needs. He then explained to them the error and deviation of worshipping the seven planets, which they said were the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The brightest of these objects and the most honored to them was the Sun, the Moon then Venus. Ibrahim, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, first proved that Venus is not worthy of being worshipped, for it is subservient to a term and course appointed that it does not defy, nor swerving right or left. Venus does not have any say in its affairs, for it is only a heavenly object that Allah created and made bright out of His wisdom. Venus rises from the east and sets in the west where it disappears from sight. This rotation is repeated the next night, and so forth. Such an object is not worthy of being a god. Ibrahim then went on to mention the Moon in the same manner in which he mentioned Venus, and then the Sun. When he proved that these three objects were not gods, although they are the brightest objects the eyes can see, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يقَوْمِ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.\") meaning, I am free from worshipping these objects and from taking them as protectors. Therefore, if they are indeed gods as you claim, then all of you bring your plot against me and do not give me respite. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّذِى فَطَرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, Hanifan, and I am not one of the idolators.) meaning, I worship the Creator of these things, Who originated and decreed them, and Who governs their affairs and made them subservient. It is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of all things, and He is the Creator, Lord, King and God of all things in existence. In another Ayah, Allah said؛ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, and then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars, subjecting them to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54. Allah described Prophet Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَـلِمِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـذِهِ التَّمَـثِيلُ الَّتِى أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَـكِفُونَ </div><p>(And indeed We bestowed aforetime on Ibrahim his (portion of) guidance, and We were well-acquainted with him. When he said to his father and his people: \"What are these images, to which you are devoted\") 21:51-52. These Ayat indicate that Ibrahim was debating with his people about the Shirk they practiced. </p>"

In the first case with his father, Ibrahim explained to his people their error in worshipping the idols of earth, which they made in the shape of heavenly angels, so that they intercede on their behalf with the Glorious Creator. His people thought that they are too insignificant to worship Allah directly, and this is why they turned to the worship of angels as intercessors with Allah for their provisions, gaining victory and attaining their various needs. He then explained to them the error and deviation of worshipping the seven planets, which they said were the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The brightest of these objects and the most honored to them was the Sun, the Moon then Venus. Ibrahim, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, first proved that Venus is not worthy of being worshipped, for it is subservient to a term and course appointed that it does not defy, nor swerving right or left. Venus does not have any say in its affairs, for it is only a heavenly object that Allah created and made bright out of His wisdom. Venus rises from the east and sets in the west where it disappears from sight. This rotation is repeated the next night, and so forth. Such an object is not worthy of being a god. Ibrahim then went on to mention the Moon in the same manner in which he mentioned Venus, and then the Sun. When he proved that these three objects were not gods, although they are the brightest objects the eyes can see, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يقَوْمِ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.\") meaning, I am free from worshipping these objects and from taking them as protectors. Therefore, if they are indeed gods as you claim, then all of you bring your plot against me and do not give me respite. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّذِى فَطَرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, Hanifan, and I am not one of the idolators.) meaning, I worship the Creator of these things, Who originated and decreed them, and Who governs their affairs and made them subservient. It is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of all things, and He is the Creator, Lord, King and God of all things in existence. In another Ayah, Allah said؛ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, and then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars, subjecting them to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54. Allah described Prophet Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَـلِمِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـذِهِ التَّمَـثِيلُ الَّتِى أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَـكِفُونَ </div><p>(And indeed We bestowed aforetime on Ibrahim his (portion of) guidance, and We were well-acquainted with him. When he said to his father and his people: \"What are these images, to which you are devoted\") 21:51-52. These Ayat indicate that Ibrahim was debating with his people about the Shirk they practiced. </p>"

Look behind you!\" He will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire.\" </p><h2>Tawhid Becomes Apparent to Ibrahim</h2><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ نُرِى إِبْرَهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth...) 6:75, means, when he contemplated about the creation of the heaven and earth, We showed Ibrahim the proofs of Allah's Oneness over His dominion and His creation, which indicate that there is no god or Lord except Allah. Allah said in other Ayat; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلِ انظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Say: \"Behold all that is in the heavens and the earth.\") 10:101, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَى مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِن نَّشَأْ نَخْسِفْ بِهِمُ الاٌّرْضَ أَوْ نُسْقِطْ عَلَيْهِمْ كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَةً لِّكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ </div><p>(See they not what is before them and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth If We will, We sink the earth with them, or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them.

This is why he said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(\"and I am not of the idolators.\") </p><h2>Prophet Ibrahim Debates with his People</h2><p>We should note here that, in these Ayat, Ibrahim, peace be upon him, was debating with his people, explaining to them the error of their way in worshipping idols and images. In the first case with his father, Ibrahim explained to his people their error in worshipping the idols of earth, which they made in the shape of heavenly angels, so that they intercede on their behalf with the Glorious Creator. His people thought that they are too insignificant to worship Allah directly, and this is why they turned to the worship of angels as intercessors with Allah for their provisions, gaining victory and attaining their various needs. He then explained to them the error and deviation of worshipping the seven planets, which they said were the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The brightest of these objects and the most honored to them was the Sun, the Moon then Venus. Ibrahim, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, first proved that Venus is not worthy of being worshipped, for it is subservient to a term and course appointed that it does not defy, nor swerving right or left. Venus does not have any say in its affairs, for it is only a heavenly object that Allah created and made bright out of His wisdom. Venus rises from the east and sets in the west where it disappears from sight. This rotation is repeated the next night, and so forth. Such an object is not worthy of being a god. Ibrahim then went on to mention the Moon in the same manner in which he mentioned Venus, and then the Sun. When he proved that these three objects were not gods, although they are the brightest objects the eyes can see, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يقَوْمِ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.\") meaning, I am free from worshipping these objects and from taking them as protectors. Therefore, if they are indeed gods as you claim, then all of you bring your plot against me and do not give me respite. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِىَ لِلَّذِى فَطَرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, Hanifan, and I am not one of the idolators.) meaning, I worship the Creator of these things, Who originated and decreed them, and Who governs their affairs and made them subservient. It is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of all things, and He is the Creator, Lord, King and God of all things in existence. In another Ayah, Allah said؛ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, and then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars, subjecting them to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54. Allah described Prophet Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَـلِمِينَ - إِذْ قَالَ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـذِهِ التَّمَـثِيلُ الَّتِى أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَـكِفُونَ </div><p>(And indeed We bestowed aforetime on Ibrahim his (portion of) guidance, and We were well-acquainted with him. When he said to his father and his people: \"What are these images, to which you are devoted\") 21:51-52. These Ayat indicate that Ibrahim was debating with his people about the Shirk they practiced. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Ibrahim Receives the News of Ishaq and Ya`qub During His Old Age</h2><p>Allah states that after Ibrahim became old and he, and his wife, Sarah, lost hope of having children, He gave them Ishaq. The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ - قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ </div><p>(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!\" They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\") 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً </div><p>(So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا</div><p>(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. </p><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2><p>Each of these two Prophets had special qualities. When Allah caused the people of the earth to drown, except those who believed in Nuh and accompanied him in the ark, Allah made the offspring of Nuh the dwellers of the earth thereafter. Ever since that occurred, the people of the earth were and still are the descendants of Nuh. As for Ibrahim, Allah did not send a Prophet after him but from his descendants. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْرَءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً </div><p>(Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.) 19:58 Allah said in this honorable Ayah here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ</div><p>(and among his progeny...) meaning, We guided from among his offspring, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(Dawud, Sulayman...) from the offspring of Nuh, according to Ibn Jarir. It is also possible that the Ayah refers to Ibrahim since it is about him that the blessings were originally mentioned here, although Lut is not from his offspring, for he was Ibrahim's nephew, the son of his brother Maran, the son of Azar. It is possible to say that Lut was mentioned in Ibrahim's offspring as a generalization. As Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to Him we submit.\") 2:133. Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblis -- he refused to be among those to prostrate.) 15:30-31. Allah included Iblis in His order to the angels to prostrate, and chastised him for his opposition, all because he was similar to them in that (order), so he was considered among them in general, although he was a Jinn. Iblis was created from fire while the angels were created from light. Mentioning `Isa in the offspring of Ibrahim, or Nuh as we stated above, is proof that the grandchildren from a man's daughter's side are included among his offspring. `Isa is included among Ibrahim's progeny through his mother, although `Isa did not have a father. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Harb bin Abi Al-Aswad said, \"Al-Hajjaj sent to Yahya bin Ya`mar, saying, `I was told that you claim that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are from the offspring of the Prophet , did you find it in the Book of Allah I read the Qur'an from beginning to end and did not find it.' Yahya said, `Do you not read in Surat Al-An`am, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى</div><p>(and Yahya and `Isa...) Al-Hajjaj said, `Yes.' Yahya said, `Is not `Isa from the offspring of Ibrahim, although he did not have a father' Al-Hajjaj said, `You have said the truth.\"' For example, when a man leaves behind a legacy, a trust, or gift to his \"offspring\" then the children of his daughters are included. But if a man gives something to his \"sons\", or he leaves a trust behind for them, then that would be particular to his male children and their male children. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءابَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ</div><p>(And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren,) 6:87, mentions that some of these Prophets' ascendants and descendants were also guided and chosen. So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.) </p><h2>Shirk Eradicates the Deeds, Even the Deeds of the Messengers</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(This is the guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He wills of His servants.) meaning, this occurred to them by Allah's leave and because He directed them to guidance. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُواْ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.) This magnifies the serious danger of Shirk and the gravity of committing it. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أُوْحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ</div><p>(And indeed it has been revealed to you, as it was to those (Allah's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allah, surely your deeds will be in vain.\") 39:65 `If' here does not mean that this would ever occur, as is similar in Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If the Most Beneficent had a son, then I am the first of Allah's worshippers.\") 43:81, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ </div><p>(If We intended to take a pastime (a wife or a son, etc.) We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that)) 21:17, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(If Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Compelling.) 39:4 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ</div><p>(They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm, and prophethood.)

This Ayah means, if the Quraysh and the rest of the people of the earth - Arabs and non-Arabs, illiterate and the People of the Scripture - disbelieve in these bounties, then We have entrusted them to another people, the Muhajirun and Ansar, and those who follow their lead until the Day of Resurrection, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(who are not disbelievers therein.) They will not deny any of these favors, not even one letter. Rather, they will believe in them totally, even the parts that are not so clear to some of them. We ask Allah to make us among them by His favor, generosity and kindness. Addressing His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ</div><p>(They are...) the Prophets mentioned here, along with their righteous fathers, offspring and bretheren, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(those whom Allah had guided.) meaning, they alone are the people of guidance, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(So follow their guidance.) Imitate them. This command to the Messenger certainly applies to his Ummah, according to what he legislates and commands them. While mentioning this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Mujahid asked Ibn `Abbas, \"Is there an instance where prostration is warranted in Surah Sad\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Yes.\" He then recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(...And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(...So follow their guidance.) He commented, \"He (our Prophet, Muhammad ) was among them.\" In another narration, Mujahid added that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Your Prophet was among those whose guidance we were commanded to follow.\" Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لاَّ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً</div><p>(Say: \"No reward I ask of you for this.\") means, I do not ask you for any reward for delivering the Qur'an to you, nor anything else, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرَى لِلْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(\"It is only a reminder for the `Alamin (mankind and Jinns).\") so they are reminded by it and guided from blindness to clarity, from misguidance to guidance, and from disbelief to faith. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Ibrahim Receives the News of Ishaq and Ya`qub During His Old Age</h2><p>Allah states that after Ibrahim became old and he, and his wife, Sarah, lost hope of having children, He gave them Ishaq. The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ - قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ </div><p>(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!\" They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\") 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً </div><p>(So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا</div><p>(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. </p><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2><p>Each of these two Prophets had special qualities.

Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together.

Addressing His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ</div><p>(They are...) the Prophets mentioned here, along with their righteous fathers, offspring and bretheren, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(those whom Allah had guided.) meaning, they alone are the people of guidance, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(So follow their guidance.) Imitate them. This command to the Messenger certainly applies to his Ummah, according to what he legislates and commands them.

      "text": "<h2>Ibrahim Receives the News of Ishaq and Ya`qub During His Old Age</h2><p>Allah states that after Ibrahim became old and he, and his wife, Sarah, lost hope of having children, He gave them Ishaq. The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ - قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ </div><p>(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!\" They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\") 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً </div><p>(So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا</div><p>(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. </p><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2><p>Each of these two Prophets had special qualities. When Allah caused the people of the earth to drown, except those who believed in Nuh and accompanied him in the ark, Allah made the offspring of Nuh the dwellers of the earth thereafter. Ever since that occurred, the people of the earth were and still are the descendants of Nuh. As for Ibrahim, Allah did not send a Prophet after him but from his descendants. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْرَءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً </div><p>(Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.) 19:58 Allah said in this honorable Ayah here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ</div><p>(and among his progeny...) meaning, We guided from among his offspring, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(Dawud, Sulayman...) from the offspring of Nuh, according to Ibn Jarir. It is also possible that the Ayah refers to Ibrahim since it is about him that the blessings were originally mentioned here, although Lut is not from his offspring, for he was Ibrahim's nephew, the son of his brother Maran, the son of Azar. It is possible to say that Lut was mentioned in Ibrahim's offspring as a generalization. As Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to Him we submit.\") 2:133. Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblis -- he refused to be among those to prostrate.) 15:30-31. Allah included Iblis in His order to the angels to prostrate, and chastised him for his opposition, all because he was similar to them in that (order), so he was considered among them in general, although he was a Jinn. Iblis was created from fire while the angels were created from light. Mentioning `Isa in the offspring of Ibrahim, or Nuh as we stated above, is proof that the grandchildren from a man's daughter's side are included among his offspring. `Isa is included among Ibrahim's progeny through his mother, although `Isa did not have a father. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Harb bin Abi Al-Aswad said, \"Al-Hajjaj sent to Yahya bin Ya`mar, saying, `I was told that you claim that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are from the offspring of the Prophet , did you find it in the Book of Allah I read the Qur'an from beginning to end and did not find it.' Yahya said, `Do you not read in Surat Al-An`am, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى</div><p>(and Yahya and `Isa...) Al-Hajjaj said, `Yes.' Yahya said, `Is not `Isa from the offspring of Ibrahim, although he did not have a father' Al-Hajjaj said, `You have said the truth.\"' For example, when a man leaves behind a legacy, a trust, or gift to his \"offspring\" then the children of his daughters are included. But if a man gives something to his \"sons\", or he leaves a trust behind for them, then that would be particular to his male children and their male children. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءابَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ</div><p>(And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren,) 6:87, mentions that some of these Prophets' ascendants and descendants were also guided and chosen. So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.) </p><h2>Shirk Eradicates the Deeds, Even the Deeds of the Messengers</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(This is the guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He wills of His servants.) meaning, this occurred to them by Allah's leave and because He directed them to guidance. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُواْ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.) This magnifies the serious danger of Shirk and the gravity of committing it. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أُوْحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ</div><p>(And indeed it has been revealed to you, as it was to those (Allah's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allah, surely your deeds will be in vain.\") 39:65 `If' here does not mean that this would ever occur, as is similar in Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If the Most Beneficent had a son, then I am the first of Allah's worshippers.\") 43:81, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ </div><p>(If We intended to take a pastime (a wife or a son, etc.) We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that)) 21:17, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(If Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Compelling.) 39:4 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ</div><p>(They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm, and prophethood.) We bestowed these bounties on them, as a mercy for the servants, and out of our kindness for creation. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن يَكْفُرْ بِهَا</div><p>(But if they disbelieve therein...) in the prophethood, or the three things; the Book, the Hukm and the prophethood, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـؤُلاءِ</div><p>(They...) refers to the people of Makkah, according to Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi, and others. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْماً لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers therein.) This Ayah means, if the Quraysh and the rest of the people of the earth - Arabs and non-Arabs, illiterate and the People of the Scripture - disbelieve in these bounties, then We have entrusted them to another people, the Muhajirun and Ansar, and those who follow their lead until the Day of Resurrection, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(who are not disbelievers therein.) They will not deny any of these favors, not even one letter. Rather, they will believe in them totally, even the parts that are not so clear to some of them. We ask Allah to make us among them by His favor, generosity and kindness.

This Ayah means, if the Quraysh and the rest of the people of the earth - Arabs and non-Arabs, illiterate and the People of the Scripture - disbelieve in these bounties, then We have entrusted them to another people, the Muhajirun and Ansar, and those who follow their lead until the Day of Resurrection, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(who are not disbelievers therein.) They will not deny any of these favors, not even one letter. Rather, they will believe in them totally, even the parts that are not so clear to some of them.

      "text": "<h2>Ibrahim Receives the News of Ishaq and Ya`qub During His Old Age</h2><p>Allah states that after Ibrahim became old and he, and his wife, Sarah, lost hope of having children, He gave them Ishaq. The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ - قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ </div><p>(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!\" They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\") 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً </div><p>(So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا</div><p>(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. </p><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2><p>Each of these two Prophets had special qualities. When Allah caused the people of the earth to drown, except those who believed in Nuh and accompanied him in the ark, Allah made the offspring of Nuh the dwellers of the earth thereafter. Ever since that occurred, the people of the earth were and still are the descendants of Nuh. As for Ibrahim, Allah did not send a Prophet after him but from his descendants. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْرَءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً </div><p>(Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.) 19:58 Allah said in this honorable Ayah here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ</div><p>(and among his progeny...) meaning, We guided from among his offspring, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(Dawud, Sulayman...) from the offspring of Nuh, according to Ibn Jarir. It is also possible that the Ayah refers to Ibrahim since it is about him that the blessings were originally mentioned here, although Lut is not from his offspring, for he was Ibrahim's nephew, the son of his brother Maran, the son of Azar. It is possible to say that Lut was mentioned in Ibrahim's offspring as a generalization. As Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to Him we submit.\") 2:133. Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblis -- he refused to be among those to prostrate.) 15:30-31. Allah included Iblis in His order to the angels to prostrate, and chastised him for his opposition, all because he was similar to them in that (order), so he was considered among them in general, although he was a Jinn. Iblis was created from fire while the angels were created from light. Mentioning `Isa in the offspring of Ibrahim, or Nuh as we stated above, is proof that the grandchildren from a man's daughter's side are included among his offspring. `Isa is included among Ibrahim's progeny through his mother, although `Isa did not have a father. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Harb bin Abi Al-Aswad said, \"Al-Hajjaj sent to Yahya bin Ya`mar, saying, `I was told that you claim that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are from the offspring of the Prophet , did you find it in the Book of Allah I read the Qur'an from beginning to end and did not find it.' Yahya said, `Do you not read in Surat Al-An`am, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى</div><p>(and Yahya and `Isa...) Al-Hajjaj said, `Yes.' Yahya said, `Is not `Isa from the offspring of Ibrahim, although he did not have a father' Al-Hajjaj said, `You have said the truth.\"' For example, when a man leaves behind a legacy, a trust, or gift to his \"offspring\" then the children of his daughters are included. But if a man gives something to his \"sons\", or he leaves a trust behind for them, then that would be particular to his male children and their male children. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءابَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ</div><p>(And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren,) 6:87, mentions that some of these Prophets' ascendants and descendants were also guided and chosen. So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.) </p><h2>Shirk Eradicates the Deeds, Even the Deeds of the Messengers</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(This is the guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He wills of His servants.) meaning, this occurred to them by Allah's leave and because He directed them to guidance. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُواْ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.) This magnifies the serious danger of Shirk and the gravity of committing it. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أُوْحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ</div><p>(And indeed it has been revealed to you, as it was to those (Allah's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allah, surely your deeds will be in vain.\") 39:65 `If' here does not mean that this would ever occur, as is similar in Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If the Most Beneficent had a son, then I am the first of Allah's worshippers.\") 43:81, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ </div><p>(If We intended to take a pastime (a wife or a son, etc.) We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that)) 21:17, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(If Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him!

Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْرَءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً </div><p>(Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.) 19:58 Allah said in this honorable Ayah here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ</div><p>(and among his progeny...) meaning, We guided from among his offspring, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(Dawud, Sulayman...) from the offspring of Nuh, according to Ibn Jarir. It is also possible that the Ayah refers to Ibrahim since it is about him that the blessings were originally mentioned here, although Lut is not from his offspring, for he was Ibrahim's nephew, the son of his brother Maran, the son of Azar. It is possible to say that Lut was mentioned in Ibrahim's offspring as a generalization. As Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to Him we submit.\") 2:133. Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblis -- he refused to be among those to prostrate.) 15:30-31. Allah included Iblis in His order to the angels to prostrate, and chastised him for his opposition, all because he was similar to them in that (order), so he was considered among them in general, although he was a Jinn. Iblis was created from fire while the angels were created from light. Mentioning `Isa in the offspring of Ibrahim, or Nuh as we stated above, is proof that the grandchildren from a man's daughter's side are included among his offspring. `Isa is included among Ibrahim's progeny through his mother, although `Isa did not have a father. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Harb bin Abi Al-Aswad said, \"Al-Hajjaj sent to Yahya bin Ya`mar, saying, `I was told that you claim that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are from the offspring of the Prophet , did you find it in the Book of Allah I read the Qur'an from beginning to end and did not find it.' Yahya said, `Do you not read in Surat Al-An`am, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى</div><p>(and Yahya and `Isa...) Al-Hajjaj said, `Yes.' Yahya said, `Is not `Isa from the offspring of Ibrahim, although he did not have a father' Al-Hajjaj said, `You have said the truth.\"' For example, when a man leaves behind a legacy, a trust, or gift to his \"offspring\" then the children of his daughters are included. But if a man gives something to his \"sons\", or he leaves a trust behind for them, then that would be particular to his male children and their male children. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءابَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ</div><p>(And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren,) 6:87, mentions that some of these Prophets' ascendants and descendants were also guided and chosen. So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.) </p><h2>Shirk Eradicates the Deeds, Even the Deeds of the Messengers</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِى بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(This is the guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He wills of His servants.) meaning, this occurred to them by Allah's leave and because He directed them to guidance. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُواْ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.) This magnifies the serious danger of Shirk and the gravity of committing it. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أُوْحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ</div><p>(And indeed it has been revealed to you, as it was to those (Allah's Messengers) before you: \"If you join others in worship with Allah, surely your deeds will be in vain.\") 39:65 `If' here does not mean that this would ever occur, as is similar in Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If the Most Beneficent had a son, then I am the first of Allah's worshippers.\") 43:81, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ </div><p>(If We intended to take a pastime (a wife or a son, etc.) We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that)) 21:17, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(If Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He created.

This Ayah means, if the Quraysh and the rest of the people of the earth - Arabs and non-Arabs, illiterate and the People of the Scripture - disbelieve in these bounties, then We have entrusted them to another people, the Muhajirun and Ansar, and those who follow their lead until the Day of Resurrection, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(who are not disbelievers therein.) They will not deny any of these favors, not even one letter. Rather, they will believe in them totally, even the parts that are not so clear to some of them. We ask Allah to make us among them by His favor, generosity and kindness. Addressing His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ</div><p>(They are...) the Prophets mentioned here, along with their righteous fathers, offspring and bretheren, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(those whom Allah had guided.) meaning, they alone are the people of guidance, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(So follow their guidance.) Imitate them. This command to the Messenger certainly applies to his Ummah, according to what he legislates and commands them. While mentioning this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Mujahid asked Ibn `Abbas, \"Is there an instance where prostration is warranted in Surah Sad\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Yes.\" He then recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(...And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub...) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(...So follow their guidance.) He commented, \"He (our Prophet, Muhammad ) was among them.\" In another narration, Mujahid added that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Your Prophet was among those whose guidance we were commanded to follow.\" Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لاَّ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً</div><p>(Say: \"No reward I ask of you for this.\") means, I do not ask you for any reward for delivering the Qur'an to you, nor anything else, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرَى لِلْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(\"It is only a reminder for the `Alamin (mankind and Jinns).\") so they are reminded by it and guided from blindness to clarity, from misguidance to guidance, and from disbelief to faith. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Ibrahim Receives the News of Ishaq and Ya`qub During His Old Age</h2><p>Allah states that after Ibrahim became old and he, and his wife, Sarah, lost hope of having children, He gave them Ishaq. The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا إِنَّ هَـذَا لَشَىْءٌ عَجِيبٌ - قَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ </div><p>(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!\" They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\") 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشَّرْنَـهُ بِإِسْحَـقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِسْحَـقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً </div><p>(So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا</div><p>(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. </p><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2><p>Each of these two Prophets had special qualities. When Allah caused the people of the earth to drown, except those who believed in Nuh and accompanied him in the ark, Allah made the offspring of Nuh the dwellers of the earth thereafter. Ever since that occurred, the people of the earth were and still are the descendants of Nuh. As for Ibrahim, Allah did not send a Prophet after him but from his descendants. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْرَءِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَاجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً </div><p>(Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose.

Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ - إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together.

Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, the Son of Adam will be brought, as if he were a golden chariot and Allah, the Most Honored, will ask, `Where is what you collected' He will reply, `O Lord! I collected it and left it as intact as ever.' Allah will say to him, `O Son of Adam! Where is what you sent forth for yourself (of righteous, good deeds),' and he will realize that he did not send forth anything for himself.\" Al-Hasan then recited the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَّا خَوَّلْنَـكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ</div><p>(And truly you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time.

Allah said in the beginning of the Surah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَـتِ وَالنُّورَ</div><p>(And originated the darkness and the light.) Indeed, Allah causes the darkness of the night to disappear and brings forth the day, thus bringing brighteness to the world and light to the horizon, while dissipating darkness and ending the night with its depth of darkness and starting the day with its brightness and light. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا</div><p>(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly.) 7:54 In this Ayah, Allah reminds of His ability to create diversified things in opposites, testifying to His perfect greatness and supreme power. Allah states that He is the Cleaver of the daybreak and mentioned its opposite, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً</div><p>(He has appointed the night for resting,) meaning, created darkness, in order for the creation to become halt and rest during it.

Both the sun and the moon have distinct positions that they assume in summer and winter, effecting changes in the length of night and day. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَآءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُوراً وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ</div><p>(It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the Moon as a light and measured out stages for it.) 10:5, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ </div><p>(It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day.

He is the Knower of all things and nothing ever escapes His knowledge, not even the weight of an atom on earth or in heavens. Allah often mentions the creation of the night, the day, the sun and the moon and then ends His Speech by mentioning His attributes of power and knowledge, as in this Ayah above 6:96, and in His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ الَّيْلُ نَسْلَخُ مِنْهُ النَّهَارَ فَإِذَا هُم مُّظْلِمُونَ - وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ </div><p>(And a sign for them is the night, We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are in darkness.

Such is the decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower.) 41:12 Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُواْ بِهَا فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ</div><p>(It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea.)

This Ayah means, contemplate the ability of the Creator of these fruits, Who brought them into existence after they were dry wood, and they later became grapes and dates; and similar is the case with the various colors, shapes, tastes and fragrance of whatever Allah created.

They, or most of them, also said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمُسْتَوْدَعٌ</div><p>(And Mustawda`,) means, `in your father's loins'. Ibn Mas`ud and several others said that, Mustaqar, means residence in this life, while, Mustawda`, means the place of storage after death (the grave). Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الاٌّيَـتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَفْقَهُونَ</div><p>(Indeed, We have explained in detail Our revelations for people who understand.) refers to those who comprehend and understand Allah's Words and its meanings.

This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. Allah's statement </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَنَّـتٍ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ</div><p>(and gardens of grapes,) means, We bring forth gardens of grapes. Grapes and dates are the most precious fruits to the people of Al-Hijaz (Western Arabia), and perhaps both are the best fruits in this world. Allah has reminded His servants of His favor in making these two fruits for them, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ثَمَرَتِ النَّخِيلِ وَالاٌّعْنَـبِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَرًا وَرِزْقًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you derive strong drink and a goodly provision.) 16:67 before intoxicating drinks were prohibited, and; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا جَنَّـتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَـبٍ</div><p>(And We have made therein gardens of date-palms and grapes.) 36:34.

The leaves are similar in shape and appearence, yet different in the shape, and taste.

This Ayah means, contemplate the ability of the Creator of these fruits, Who brought them into existence after they were dry wood, and they later became grapes and dates; and similar is the case with the various colors, shapes, tastes and fragrance of whatever Allah created. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَـوِرَتٌ وَجَنَّـتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَـبٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَنٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَنٍ يُسْقَى بِمَآءٍ وَحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ فِى الاٍّكُلِ</div><p>(And in the earth are neighbouring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops, and date-palms, growing out, two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise, watered with the same water, yet some of them We make better than others to eat.) 13:4 This is why Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذلِكُمْ</div><p>(In these things there are...)

Glory be to Allah above this Shirk and Kufr. If someone asks, how did the idolators worship the Jinns, although they only were idol worshippers The answer is that in fact, they worshipped the idols by obeying the Jinns who commanded them to do so. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَـثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَـناً مَّرِيداً - لَّعَنَهُ اللَّهُ وَقَالَ لاّتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً - وَلأضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلاّمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ ءَاذَانَ الاٌّنْعَـمِ وَلاّمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَّخِذِ الشَّيْطَـنَ وَلِيّاً مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَاناً مُّبِيناً - يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً </div><p>(They invoke nothing but female deities besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytan, a persistent rebel!

Allah mentions the misguidance of those who were led astray and claimed a son or offspring for Him, as the Jews did with `Uzayr, the Christians with `Isa and the Arab pagans with the angels whom they claimed were Allah's daughters. Allah is far holier than what the unjust, polytheist people associate with Him. The word, Kharaqu, means `falsely attributed, invented, claimed and lied', according to the scholars of the Salaf.

They say that \"it\" refers to eating it, and others say that it refers to the sacrifice for other than Allah. There are various Hadiths that order mentioning Allah's Name when slaughtering and hunting.

This Hadith was collected in the Two Sahihs. The Rafi` bin Khadij narrated that the Prophet said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا أَنْهَرَ الدَّمَ وَذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ فَكُلُوه»</div><p>(You can use what would make blood flow (i. e., slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering.) This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Mas`ud narrated that Allah's Messenger said to the Jinns. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَكُمْ كُلُّ عَظْمٍ ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللهِ عَلَيْه»</div><p>((For food) you have every bone on which Allah's Name was mentioned on slaughtering.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Jundub bin Sufyan Al-Bajali said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَ فَلْيَذْبَحْ مَكَانَهَا أُخْرَى، وَمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ ذَبَحَ، حَتَّى صَلَّيْنَا فَلْيَذْبَحْ بِاسْمِ الله»</div><p>(Whoever slaughtered before he prayed (the `Id prayer), let him slaughter another sacrifice in its place.

Abu Ishaq (Al-Mukhtar) claimed that he received revelation this night.' Ibn `Abbas said, He has said the truth.' I was upset and said, `Ibn `Abbas says that Al-Mukhtar has said the truth' Ibn `Abbas replied, `There are two types of revelation, one from Allah and one from the devil. Allah's revelation came to Muhammad , while the Shaytan's revelation comes to his friends.' He then recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ الشَّيَـطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَآئِهِمْ</div><p>(And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends...)

The disbelievers used to call the Prophet , before he received revelation, `Al-Amin' -- the Truthful. The leader of the Quraysh disbelievers, Abu Sufyan, had to admit to this fact when Heraclius, emperor of Rome, asked him, \"How honorable is his (the Prophet's) ancestral lineage among you\" Abu Sufyan answered, \"His ancestry is highly regarded among us.\" Heraclius asked, \"Do you find that he lied, before he started his mission\" Abu Sufyan replied, \"No.\" The emperor of Rome relied on the honor and purity of the Prophet to recognize the truth of his prophethood and what he came with. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ اصْطَفَى مِنْ وَلَدِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِسْمَاعِيلَ، وَاصْطَفَى مِنْ بَنِي إِسْمَاعِيلَ بَنِي كِنَانَةَ وَاصْطَفَى مِنْ بَنِي كِنَانَةَ قُرَيْشًا وَاصْطَفَى مِنْنُقرَيْشٍ بَنِي هَاشِمٍ وَاصْطَفَانِي مِنْ بَنِي هَاشِم»</div><p>(Verily, Allah has chosen Isma`il from the offspring of Ibrahim, Bani Kinanah from the offspring of Isma`il, Quraysh from Bani Kinanah, Bani Hashim from Quraysh and, He has chosen me from Bani Hashim.) Muslim recorded this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ مِنْ خَيْرِ قُرُونِ بَنِي آدَمَ قَرْنًا فَقَرْنًا، حَتَّى بُعِثْتُ مِنَ الْقَرْنِ الَّذِي كُنْتُ فِيه»</div><p>(I was chosen from a succession of the best generations of the Children of Adam, until the generation I was sent in.) Allah's said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيُصِيبُ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ صَغَارٌ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Humiliation and disgrace from Allah and a severe torment will overtake the criminals...) This is a stern threat and sure promise from Allah for those who arrogantly refrain from obeying His Messengers and adhering to what they came with. On the Day of Resurrection, they will suffer humiliation and eternal disgrace before Allah, because they were arrogant in the worldly life. This is why it is befitting that they earn disgrace on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</div><p>(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) 40:60 disgrace and dishonor. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَمْكُرُونَ</div><p>(and a severe torment for that which they used to plot.) Since plotting usually takes place in secret and involves treachery and deceit, the disbelievers were recompensed with severe torment from Allah on the Day of Resurrection, as a just reckoning, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</div><p>(And your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49 Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ </div><p>(The Day when all the secrets will be examined. ) 86:9 Meaning, the secrets, hidden thoughts and intentions will be exposed. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُنْصَبُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَيُقَالُ: هَذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَان»</div><p>(A banner will be raised for every deceitful person from his anus on the Day of Resurrection, and it will say; `This is the treacherous plot of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, son of so-and-so.,) The wisdom in this is that since a plot occurs in secret, and people are usually unaware of it, then on the Day of Resurrection the plot itself will become public news testifying to the actions of those who committed it. </p>"

Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ مِنْ خَيْرِ قُرُونِ بَنِي آدَمَ قَرْنًا فَقَرْنًا، حَتَّى بُعِثْتُ مِنَ الْقَرْنِ الَّذِي كُنْتُ فِيه»</div><p>(I was chosen from a succession of the best generations of the Children of Adam, until the generation I was sent in.) Allah's said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيُصِيبُ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ صَغَارٌ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ</div><p>(Humiliation and disgrace from Allah and a severe torment will overtake the criminals...) This is a stern threat and sure promise from Allah for those who arrogantly refrain from obeying His Messengers and adhering to what they came with. On the Day of Resurrection, they will suffer humiliation and eternal disgrace before Allah, because they were arrogant in the worldly life. This is why it is befitting that they earn disgrace on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</div><p>(Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) 40:60 disgrace and dishonor. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَمْكُرُونَ</div><p>(and a severe torment for that which they used to plot.) Since plotting usually takes place in secret and involves treachery and deceit, the disbelievers were recompensed with severe torment from Allah on the Day of Resurrection, as a just reckoning, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</div><p>(And your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49 Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ </div><p>(The Day when all the secrets will be examined. ) 86:9 Meaning, the secrets, hidden thoughts and intentions will be exposed. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُنْصَبُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، فَيُقَالُ: هَذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَان»</div><p>(A banner will be raised for every deceitful person from his anus on the Day of Resurrection, and it will say; `This is the treacherous plot of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, son of so-and-so.,) The wisdom in this is that since a plot occurs in secret, and people are usually unaware of it, then on the Day of Resurrection the plot itself will become public news testifying to the actions of those who committed it. </p>"

Consequently, Shaytan lures and hinders them from the path of Allah.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that, Rijs, refers to Shaytan, while Mujahid said that it refers to all that does not contain goodness. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that, Rijs, means, `torment'. </p>"

This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ</div><p>(And they assign to Allah from that which He has created,) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنَ الْحَرْثِ</div><p>(of the tilth) meaning, fruits and produce, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً</div><p>(and of the cattle a share) meaning a part and a section. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا</div><p>(and they say: \"This is for Allah,\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\") Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ</div><p>(But the share of their \"partners\" reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their \"partners\"!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi narrated that Ibn `Abbas said; \"When they, the enemies of Allah, would cultivate the land or collect produce, they would assign a part of it to Allah and another part to the idol. They would keep the share for the idol, whether land, produce or anything else, and preserve its division to such an extent that they would collect anything that accidentally falls from the share they assigned to Allah and add it to the share of the idol. If the water that they assigned for the idol irrigated something (a section of land, for instance) that they assigned for Allah, they would add whatever this water irrigated to the idol's share! If the land or produce that they assigned for Allah was accidentally mixed with the share that they assigned for the idol, they would say that the idol is poor. Therefore, they would add it to the share they assigned for the idol and would not return it to the share they assigned for Allah. If the water that they assigned for Allah irrigated what they assigned for the idol they would leave it (the produce) for the idol. They also made some of their other property sacred, like the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham, assigning them to the idols, claiming that they do so as way of seeking a means of approach to Allah. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً</div><p>(And they assign to Allah a share of the tilth and cattle which He has created...).\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented; \"Every type of slaughter that they would assign for Allah, would never be eaten unless they mentioned the names of their idols when slaughtering it. Yet for what they sacrificed in the names of the idols, they would not mention Allah's Name when slaughtering it.\" He then recited the Ayah (6:136) until he reached, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</div><p>(Evil is the way they judge!) This Ayah means, evil is that which they determined, for they committed error in the division. Certainly, Allah is the Lord, Owner and Creator of all things and His is the dominion. All things are His property and under His supreme control, will and decree. There is no deity worthy of worship, or Lord, except Him. And even when the polytheists made this evil division, they did not preserve it, but cheated in it. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ الْبَنَـتِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَلَهُمْ مَّا يَشْتَهُونَ </div><p>(And they assign daughters unto Allah -- glory be to Him -- and unto themselves what they desire.) 16:57, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him.

Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَ جَنَّـتٍ مَّعْرُوشَـتٍ وَغَيْرَ مَعْرُوشَـتٍ</div><p>(And it is He Who produces gardens Ma`rushat and not Ma`rushat,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"Ma`rushat refers to what the people trellise, while `not Ma`rushat' refers to fruits (and produce) that grow wild inland and on mountains.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ma`rushat are the grapevines that are trellised, while `not Ma`rushat' refers to grapevines that are not trellised.\" As-Suddi said similarly. As for these fruits being similar, yet different, Ibn Jurayj said, \"They are similar in shape, but different in taste.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ</div><p>(Eat of their fruit when they ripen,) means, \"(Eat) from the dates and grapes they produce.\" Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) Mujahid commented, \"When the poor people are present (on the day of harvest), give them some of the produce.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid commented on the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest.) \"When planting, one gives away handfuls (of seed grains) and on harvest, he gives away handfuls and allows them to pick whatever is left on the ground of the harvest.\" Ath-Thawri said that Hammad narrated that Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"One gives away some of the hay.\" Ibn Al-Mubarak said that Shurayk said that Salim said that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</div><p>(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest,) \"This ruling, giving the poor the handfuls (of seed grains) and some of the hay as food for their animals, was before Zakah became obligatory.\" Allah has chastised those who harvest, without giving away a part of it as charity. Allah mentioned the story of the owners of the garden in Surat Nun, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا بَلَوْنَـهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ إِذْ أَقْسَمُواْ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ - وَلاَ يَسْتَثْنُونَ - فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ - فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَالصَّرِيمِ - فَتَنَادَوْاْ مُصْبِحِينَ - أَنِ اغْدُواْ عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـرِمِينَ - فَانطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَـفَتُونَ - أَن لاَّ يَدْخُلَنَّهَا الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّسْكِينٌ - وَغَدَوْاْ عَلَى حَرْدٍ قَـدِرِينَ - فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُواْ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ قَالَ أَوْسَطُهُمْ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ لَوْلاَ تُسَبِّحُونَ قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ فَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَلَـوَمُونَ قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا طَـغِينَ عَسَى رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَنَا خَيْراً مِّنْهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا رَغِبُونَ كَذَلِكَ الْعَذَابُ وَلَعَذَابُ الاٌّخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(When they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning. Without saying: \"If Allah wills.\" Then there passed by on the (garden) a visitation (fire) from your Lord at night, burning it while they were asleep. So the (garden) became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (in complete ruins). Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke. Saying: \"Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck the fruits.\" So they departed, conversing in secret low tones (saying). \"No poor person shall enter upon you into it today.\" And they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have power (to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom). But when they saw the (garden), they said: \"Verily, we have gone astray.\" (Then they said): \"Nay! Indeed we are deprived of (the fruits)!\" The best among them said: \"Did I not tell you, why say you not: `If Allah wills'.\" They said: \"Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been wrongdoers.\" Then they turned one against another, blaming. They said: \"Woe to us! We have transgressed. We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord.\" Such is the punishment (in this life), but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew.) 68:18-33. </p><h2>Prohibiting Extravagance</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ</div><p>(And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful.) It was said that the extravagance prohibited here refers to excessive charity beyond normal amounts. Ibn Jurayj said, \"This Ayah was revealed concerning Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas, who plucked the fruits of his date palms. Then he said to himself, `This day, every person who comes to me, I will feed him from it.' So he kept feeding (them) until the evening came and he ended up with no dates. Allah sent down, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ</div><p>(And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful.)\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement from Ibn Jurayj. However, thhe apparent meaning of this Ayah, and Allah knows best, is that; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ</div><p>(Eat of their fruit when they ripen, but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, and waste not...) refers to eating, meaning, do not waste in eating because this spoils the mind and the body. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ</div><p>(And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance.) 7: 31 In his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded a Hadith without a chain of narration; a </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا وَالْبَسُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ إِسْرَافٍ وَلَا مَخِيلَة»</div><p>(Eat, drink and clothe yourselves without extravagance or arrogance.) Therefore, these Ayat have the same meaning as this Hadith. and Allah knows best. </p><h2>Benefits of Cattle</h2><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ الأَنْعَـمِ حَمُولَةً وَفَرْشًا</div><p>(And of the cattle (are some) for burden and (some smaller) for Farsh.) means, He created cattle for you, some of which are suitable for burden, such as camels, and some are Farsh. Ath-Thawri narrated that Abu Ishaq said that Abu Al-Ahwas said that `Abdullah said that `animals for burden' are the camels that are used for carrying things, while, `Farsh', refers to small camels. Al-Hakim recorded it and said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that `animals for burden' refers to the animals that people ride, while, `Farsh' is that they eat (its meat) and milk it. The sheep is not able to carry things, so you eat its meat and use its wool for covers and mats (or clothes). This statement of `Abdur-Rahman is sound, and the following Ayat testify to it, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ - وَذَلَّلْنَـهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ </div><p>(Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners. And We have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding and some they eat.) 36:71-72, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى الاٌّنْعَـمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهِ مِن بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَنًا خَالِصًا سَآئِغًا لِلشَّارِبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, in the cattle, there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.) 16:66, until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ أَثَـثاً وَمَتَـعاً إِلَى حِينٍ</div><p>(And of their wool, fur and hair, furnishings and articles of convenience, comfort for a while.) 16:80. </p><h2>Eat the Meat of These Cattle, But Do Not Follow Shaytan's Law Concerning Them</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(Eat of what Allah has provided for you,) of fruits, produce and cattle. Allah created all these and provided you with them as provision. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَتِ الشَّيْطَـنِ</div><p>(and follow not the footsteps of Shaytan.) meaning, his way and orders, just as the idolators followed him and prohibited fruits and produce that Allah provided for them, claiming that this falsehood came from Allah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ</div><p>(Surely, he is to you) meaning; Shaytan, O people, is to you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(an open enemy) and his enmity to you is clear and apparent.

He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire. ) 35:6 and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـبَنِى آدَمَ لاَ يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ كَمَآ أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا لِيُرِيَهُمَا سَوْءَتِهِمَآ</div><p>(O Children of Adam!

He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَلِمَ لَا أَخَذْتُمْ مَسْكَهَا؟»</div><p>(Why did you not use its skin) She said, `Should we use the skin of a sheep that has died' Allah's Messenger said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّمَا قَالَ اللهُ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لاَ أَجِدُ فِى مَآ أُوْحِىَ إِلَىَّ مُحَرَّمًا عَلَى طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ إِلاَ أَن يَكُونَ مَيْتَةً أَوْ دَمًا مَّسْفُوحًا أَوْ لَحْمَ خِنزِيرٍ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكُمْ لَا تَطْعَمُونَهُ أَنْ تَدْبَغُوهُ فَتَنْتَفِعُوا بِه»</div><p>(Allah only said, (Say: \"I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, except Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine....) You will not be eating it if you tan its skin and benefit from it.) So she had the sheep skinned, the skin was tanned and made into a water skin that she kept until it wore out.\" Al-Bukhari and an-Nasa'i collected a similar Hadith. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ</div><p>(But whosoever is forced by necessity without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits;) Therefore, whoever is forced by necessity to eat anything that Allah has forbidden in this honorable Ayah, without transgressing his limits, then for him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(certainly, your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) We mentioned the explanation of this Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah. This honorable Ayah contradicts the idolators' innovated prohibitions for certain kinds of wealth, relying merely on their misguided ideas, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham. Allah commanded His Messenger to inform them that he does not find that such types of animals are prohibited in what Allah revealed to him. In this Ayah, Allah only prohibited dead animals, poured blood, the flesh of swine and what has been slaughtered for something other than Allah. Other things were not prohibited here, but rather treated as that which does not have a ruling, i.e., permissible. Therefore, how do you -- idolators -- claim that such items are prohibited, and why did you prohibit them when Allah did not prohibit them </p>"

The Jews used to forbid these types of foods saying that Isra'il, or Ya`qub, used to forbid them for himself so they too forbid them. This was mentioned by As-Suddi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَآ</div><p>(except what adheres to their backs) refers to the fat that clings to their backs. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوِ الْحَوَايَآ</div><p>(or their Hawaya) that is, the entrails, according to Abu Ja`far bin Jarir. He also said, \"The meaning here is, `And from ox and sheep, We forbade their fat for the Jews, except the fat on their backs and what the entrails carry.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that, Ibn `Abbas said that the, Hawaya, are the entrails. Similar was reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَا اخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ</div><p>(....or is mixed up with a bone.) means, We allowed the Jews the fat that is mixed with bones. Ibn Jurayj commented, \"The fat on the rump that is mixed with the tailbone was allowed for them, and also the fat on the legs, head, eyes and what adheres to the bones.\" As-Suddi said similarly. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ جَزَيْنَـهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ</div><p>(Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion.) meaning, We imposed this restriction on them as recompense for their rebellion and defying Our commandments. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَـتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً </div><p>(For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them -- and for their hindering many from Allah's way) 4:160. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ</div><p>(And verily, We are Truthful.) means, We were justified in the penalty We gave them. Ibn Jarir commented, \"We are Truthful in what We informed you of, O Muhammad; Our forbidding these foods for them, not as they claimed, that Israel merely forbade these things for himself (so they imitated him, they claimed).\" </p><h2>The Tricks of the Jews, and Allah's Curse</h2><p>`Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated, \"When `Umar bin Al-Khattab was told that Samurah sold liquor, he commented, `May Allah fight Samurah!

The fats were forbidden for them, so they melted the fat and sold it.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"In the year of the victory of Makkah, I heard Allah's Messenger saying; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ حَرَّمَ بَيْعَ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْتَةِ وَالْخِنْزِيرِ وَالْأَصْنَام»</div><p>(Allah and His Messenger have forbidden selling alcoholic drinks (intoxicants), dead animals, swine and idols.) He was asked, `What about the fat of dead animals They are used to dye skins, paint ships and are used as light by the people.' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا هُوَ حَرَام»</div><p>(No, it is still unlawful.) He then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَاتَلَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ إِنَّ اللهَ لَمَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهَا جَمَلُوهُ ثُمَّ بَاعُوهُ وَأَكَلُوا ثَمَنَه»</div><p>(May Allah fight the Jews!

And even if you err and your errors accumulate until they reach the boundaries of the sky and you then ask Me for forgiveness, I will forgive you.') This subject is also mentioned in the Qur'an, for Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that.) 4:116 Muslim recorded a Hadith in the Sahih that reads, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ مَاتَ لَا يُشْرِكُ بِاللهِ شَيْئًا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّـة»</div><p>(Whoever dies associating none with Allah will enter Paradise.) There are many Ayat and Hadiths on this subject. </p><h2>The Order for Kindness to Parents</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</div><p>(be kind and dutiful to your parents;) meaning, Allah has commanded and ordered you to be kind to your parents. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً</div><p>(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents.) 17:23 Allah often mentions obeying Him and being dutiful to parents together. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَصَّيْنَا الإِنْسَـنَ بِوَلِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْناً عَلَى وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِى عَامَيْنِ أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ - وَإِن جَـهَدَاكَ عَلَى أَن تُشْرِكَ بِى مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلاَ تُطِعْهُمَا وَصَـحِبْهُمَا فِى الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفاً وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَىَّ ثُمَّ إِلَىَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in this world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.) 31:14-15 Therefore, Allah ordered children to be dutiful and kind to their parents, even if they were idolators. Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَـقَ بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ لاَ تَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</div><p>(And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah and be dutiful and kind to parents.) 2:83 There are several Ayat on this subject. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"I asked Allah's Messenger about which deed is the best. He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا»</div><p>(The prayer, when it is performed on time.) I said, `Then' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن»</div><p>(Being dutiful to parents.) I asked, `Then' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</div><p>(Jihad in Allah's cause.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah said these words to me, and had I asked him for more, he would have said more.\" </p><h2>Killing Children is Forbidden</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلَـدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ</div><p>(Kill not your children because of poverty, We shall provide sustenance for you and for them.) After Allah commanded kindness to parents and grandparents, He next ordered kindness to children and grandchildren. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلَـدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ</div><p>(kill not your children because of poverty,) because the idolators used to kill their children, obeying the lures of the devils. They used to bury their daughters alive for fear of shame, and sometimes kill their sons for fear of poverty. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah , `Which sin is the biggest' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»</div><p>(To call a rival for Allah, while He Alone created you.) I said, `Then what' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»</div><p>(To kill your son for fear that he might share your food.') I said, `Then what' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تُزَانِي حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»</div><p>(To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ وَلاَ يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِى حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَلاَ يَزْنُونَ</div><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse...) 25:68.\" Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ</div><p>(Because of Imlaq) refers to poverty, according to Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. The Ayah means, do not kill your children because you are poor. Allah said in Surat Al-Isra', </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلادَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلَـقٍ</div><p>(And do not kill your children for fear from Imlaq.) 17:31, that is, do not kill your children for fear that you might become poor in the future. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُم</div><p>(We shall provide sustenance for them and for you) 17:31, thus mentioning the provision of the children first, meaning, do not fear poverty because of feeding your children. Certainly, their provision is provided by Allah. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ</div><p>(We provide sustenance for you and for them,) thus starting with parents, because this is the appropriate subject here and Allah knows. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ</div><p>(Come not near Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly) Allah said in a similar Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(Say: \"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.\") 7:33 We also explained this meaning in the explanation of the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَذَرُواْ ظَـهِرَ الإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ</div><p>(Leave sin, open and secret) 6:120. The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا أَحَدٌ أَغْيَرَ مِنَ اللهِ، مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ حَرَّمَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَن»</div><p>(None is more jealous than Allah. This is why He has forbidden the immoral sins committed openly or secretly.) `Abdul-Malik bin `Umayr said that Warrad narrated that Al-Mughirah said that Sa`d bin `Ubadah said, \"If I see a man with my wife (committing adultery), I will kill him with the sword.\" When the matter came to the Messenger of Allah , he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَعْجَبُونَ مِنْ غَيْرةِ سَعْدٍ؟ فَوَاللهِ لَأَنَا أَغْيَرُ مِنْ سَعْدٍ، وَاللهُ أَغْيَرُ مِنِّي، مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ حَرَّمَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَن»</div><p>(Do you wonder at Sa`d's jealousy By Allah, I am more jealous than Sa`d, and Allah is more jealous than I. This is why He has forbidden the immoral sins committed openly and in secret.) This Hadith is in the Two Sahihs). </p><h2>The Prohibition of Unjustified Killing</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ النَّفْسَ الَّتِى حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(And kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law).) This part of the Ayah emphasizes this prohibition in specific, although it is included in the immoral sins committed openly and in secret. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحِلُّ دَمُ امْرِىءٍ مُسْلِمٍ يَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنِّي رَسُولُ اللهِ، إِلَّا بِإِحْدَى ثَلَاثٍ: الثَّيِّبُ الزَّانِي، وَالنَّفْسُ بِالنَّفْسِ، وَالتَّارِكُ لِدِينِهِ الْمُفَارِقُ لِلْجَمَاعَة»</div><p>(The blood of a Muslim person who testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah is prohibited, except for three offenses: a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse, life for life, and whoever reverts from the religion and abandons the Jama`ah (the community of faithful believers).) There is a prohibition, a warning and a threat against killing the Mu`ahid, i.e., non-Muslims who have a treaty of peace with Muslims. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَتَلَ مُعَاهِدًا لَمْ يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًّا»</div><p>(Whoever killed a person having a treaty of protection with Muslims, shall not smell the scent of Paradise, though its scent is perceived from a distance of forty years. ) Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَتَلَ مُعَاهِدًا لَهُ ذِمَّةُ اللهِ وَذِمَّةُ رَسُولِهِ فَقَدْ أَخْفَرَ بِذِمَّةِ اللهِ، فَلَا يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ سَبْعِينَ خَرِيفًا»</div><p>(Whoever killed a person having a treaty of protection with the Muslims, and who enjoys the guarantee of Allah and His Messenger, he will have spoiled the guarantee of Allah for him. He shall not smell the scent of Paradise though its smell is perceived from a distance of seventy years.) Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكُمْ وَصَّـكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(This He has commanded you that you may understand.) means, this is what He has commanded you that you may comprehend His commandments and prohibitions. </p>"

When any of that food or drink remained, they used to keep it for the orphan until he or she ate it or it spoiled. This became difficult for the companions and they talked about it to the Messenger of Allah , and Allah sent down the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَـمَى قُلْ إِصْلاَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِن تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَنُكُمْ</div><p>(And they ask you about orphans. Say: \"The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.\") 2:220 Thereafter, they mixed their food and drink with food and drink of the orphans.\" Abu Dawud collected this statement. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ</div><p>(until he (or she) attains the age of full strength;), refers to reaching the age of adolescence, according to Ash-Sha`bi, Malik and several others among the Salaf. </p><h2>The Command to Give Full Measure and Full Weight with Justice</h2><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ</div><p>(and give full measure and full weight with justice.) is a command to establish justice while giving and taking. Allah has also warned against abandoning this commandment, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ - الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُواْ عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ - وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَوْ وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ - أَلا يَظُنُّ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَنَّهُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ - لِيَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ - يَوْمَ يَقُومُ النَّاسُ لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Woe to Al-Mutaffifin. Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure. And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due. Do they not think that they will be resurrected (for reckoning). On a Great Day The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists) 83:1-6. Allah destroyed an entire nation that was accustomed to giving less in weights and measures. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا</div><p>(We burden not any person, but that which he can bear.) that is, whoever strives while pursuing his rights and giving other peoples' full rights, then there is no sin on him if he commits an honest mistake after trying his best and striving to do what is right. </p><h2>The Order for Just Testimony</h2><p>Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُواْ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</div><p>(And whenever you give your word, say the truth even if a near relative is concerned.) This is similar to His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَآ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ للَّهِ شُهَدَآءَ بِالْقِسْطِ</div><p>(O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah as just witnesses.) 5:8 And there is a similar Ayah in Surat An-Nisa'. So Allah commands justice in action and statement, with both near relatives and distant relatives. Indeed, Allah orders justice for everyone at all times and in all situations. </p><h2>The Command to Follow Allah's Straight Path and to Avoid All Other Paths</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statements, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</div><p>(And follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path.), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنْ أَقِيمُواْ الدِّينَ وَلاَ تَتَفَرَّقُواْ فِيهِ</div><p>((Saying) that you should establish religion and make no divisions in it.) 42:13, and similar Ayat in the Qur'an, \"Allah commanded the believers to adhere to the Jama`ah and forbade them from causing divisions and disputes. He informed them that those before them were destroyed because of divisions and disputes in the religion of Allah.\" Similar was said by Mujahid and several others.

Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَـتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and Sadafa away therefrom) This refers to the one who neither benefited from what the Messenger brought, nor followed what he was sent with by abandoning all other ways. Rather, he Sadafa from following the Ayat of Allah, meaning, he discouraged and hindered people from following it. This is the explanation of As-Suddi for Sadafa, while Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Sadafa means, he turned away from it. </p>"

The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe then.) Before the commencement of the Day of Resurrection, there will come signs and portents of the Last Hour that will be witnessed by the people living at that time. In a section explaining this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا فَإِذَا رَآهَا النَّاسُ آمَنَ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَذَلِكَ حِين»</div><p>(The Last Hour will not commence until the sun rises from the west.

Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ثَلَاثٌ إِذَا خَرَجْنَ لَا يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِنْ قَبْل أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا، طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَالدَّجَّالُ وَدَابَّةُ الْأَرْض»</div><p>(Three, if they appear, then a soul will not benefit from its faith, if it had not believed before or earned good in its faith: when the sun rises from the west, Ad-Dajjal and the Beast of the earth.) Ahmad also recorded this Hadith, and in his narration, the Prophet mentioned the Smoke. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Jarir said, \"Three Muslim men sat with Marwan in Al-Madinah and they heard him talking about the signs (of the Last Hour). He said that the first sign will be the appearance of Ad-Dajjal. So these men went to `Abdullah bin `Amr and told him what they heard from Marwan about the signs. Ibn `Amr said, Marwan said nothing. I remember that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ الْآياتِ خُرُوجًا طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَخُرُوجُ الدَّابَّةِ ضُحًى فَأَيَّتُهُمَا كَانَتْ قَبْلَ صَاحِبَتِهَا فَالْأُخْرَى عَلَى أَثَرِهَا»</div><p>(The first of the signs to appear are the sun rising from the west and the Beast that appears in the early morning. Whichever comes before the other, then the second sign will appear soon after it.\") Then `Abdullah said - and he used to read the Scriptures - \"And I think the first of them is the sun rising from the west. That is because when it sets it comes under the Throne, prostrates and seeks permission to return. So it is permitted to return until Allah wants it to rise from the west. So it does as it normally would, it comes beneath the Throne, it prostrates and seeks permission to return. But it will get no response. Then it will seek permission to return again, but it will get no response, until what Allah wills of the night to pass goes by, and it realizes that if it is permitted to return it would not be able to reach the east. It says; `My Lord! The east is so far, what good would I be to the people' Until the horizons appear as a lightless ring, it seeks permission to return and is told; `Rise from your place,' so it rises upon the people from where it set.\" Then he recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,) This was also recorded by Muslim in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,) means, when the disbeliever believes then, it will not be accepted from him. As for those who were believers before, if they earned righteous deeds, they will have earned a great deal of good. If they had not done good nor repented before then, it will not be accepted from them, according to the Hadiths that we mentioned. This is also the meaning of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِى إِيمَـنِهَا خَيْرًا</div><p>(...nor earned good through his faith. ) meaning, one's good deeds will not be accepted from him unless he performed good deeds before. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلِ انتَظِرُواْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ</div><p>(Say: \"Wait you! We (too) are waiting.\") This is a stern threat to the disbelievers and a sure promise for those who delay embracing the faith and repenting until a time when faith or repentance shall not avail. This will occur when the sun rises from the west because the Last Hour will then be imminent and its major signs will have begun to appear. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَآءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّى لَهُمْ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ </div><p>(Do they then await (anything) other than the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly But some of its portents have already come; and when it is upon them, how can they benefit then by their reminder) 47:18, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَـفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَـنُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا</div><p>(So when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as partners.\" Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment.) 40:84-85 </p>"

It is apparent that this Ayah refers to all those who defy the religion of Allah, or revert from it. Allah sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that He makes it victorious and dominant above all religions. His Law is one and does not contain any contradiction or incongruity. Therefore, those who dispute in the religion, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانُواْ شِيَعاً</div><p>(...and break up into sects,) religious sects, just like those who follow the various sects, desires and misguidance - then Allah has purified His Messenger from their ways. In a similar Ayah, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ الِدِينِ مَا وَصَّى بِهِ نُوحاً وَالَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ</div><p>(He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you.)42:13 A Hadith reads, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ دِينُنَا وَاحِد»</div><p>(We, the Prophets, are half brothers but have one religion.) This, indeed, is the straight path which the Messengers have brought and which commands worshipping Allah alone without partners and adhering to the Law of the last Messenger whom Allah sent. All other paths are types of misguidance, ignorance, sheer opinion and desires; and as such, the Messengers are free from them. Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ</div><p>(You have no concern with them in the least...) 6:159. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ</div><p>(Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.) is similar to His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالصَّـبِئِينَ وَالنَّصَـرَى وَالْمَجُوسَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ</div><p>(Verily, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who worship others besides Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection.) 22:17 eAllah then mentioned His kindness in His decisions and His justice on the Day of Resurrection, when He said, </p>"

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said about his Lord, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ رَحِيمٌ مَنْ هَمَّ بِحَسَنَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ حَسَنَةً فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ عَشْرًا إِلَى سَبْعِمِائَةٍ إِلَى أَضْعَافٍ كَثِيرَةٍ. وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِسَيِّئَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ حَسَنَةً فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ وَاحِدَةً أَوْ يَمْحُوهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَلَا يَهْلِكُ عَلَى اللهِ إِلَّا هَالِك»</div><p>(Your Lord is Most Merciful. Whoever intends to perform a good deed and does not do it, it will be written for him as a good deed. If he performs it, it will be written for him as ten deeds, to seven hundred, to multifold. Whoever intends to commit an evil deed, but does not do it, it will be written for him as a good deed. If he commits it, it will be written for him as a sin, unless Allah erases it. Only those who deserve destruction will be destroyed by Allah.) Al-Bukhari, Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Ahmad also recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:مَنْ عَمِلَ حَسَنَةً فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَأَزِيدُ وَمَنْ عَمِلَ سَيِّئَةً فَجَزَاؤُهَا مِثْلُهَا أَوْ أَغْفِرُ وَمَنْ عَمِلَ قُرَابَ الْأَرْضِ خَطِيئَةً ثُمَّ لَقِيَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيْئًا جَعَلْتُ لَهُ مِثْلَهَا مَغْفِرَةً، وَمَنِ اقْتَرَبَ إِليَّ شِبْرًا اقْتَرَبْتُ إِلَيْهِ ذِرَاعًا وَمَنِ اقْتَرَبَ إِلَيَّ ذِرَاعًا اقْتَرَبْتُ إِلَيْهِ بَاعًا وَمَنْ أَتَانِي يَمْشِي أَتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَة»</div><p>(Allah says, `Whoever performs a good deed, will have tenfold for it and more. Whoever commits a sin, then his recompense will be the same, unless I forgive. Whoever commits the earth's fill of sins and then meets Me while associating none with Me, I will give him its fill of forgiveness. Whoever draws closer to Me by a hand's span, I will draw closer to him by a forearm's length. Whoever draws closer to Me by a forearm's length, I will draw closer to him by an arm's length. And whoever comes to Me walking, I will come to him running.') Muslim also collected this Hadith. Know that there are three types of people who refrain from committing a sin that they intended. There are those who refrain from committing the sin because they fear Allah, and thus will have written for them a good deed as a reward. This type contains both a good intention and a good deed. In some narrations of the Sahih, Allah says about this type, \"He has left the sin for My sake.\" Another type does not commit the sin because of forgetfulness or being busy attending to other affairs. This type of person will neither earn a sin, nor a reward. The reason being that, this person did not intend to do good, nor commit evil. Some people abandon the sin because they were unable to commit it or due to laziness, after trying to commit it and seeking the means that help commit it. This person is just like the person who commits the sin. There is an authentic Hadith that states, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا الْتَقَى الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَالْقَاتِلُ وَالْمَقْتُولُ فِي النَّار»</div><p>(When two Muslims meet with their swords, then the killer and the killed will be in the Fire.) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger! We know about the killer, so what about the killed\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَرِيصًا عَلَى قَتْلِ صَاحِبِه»</div><p>(He was eager to kill his companion.) Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani said that Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْجُمُعَةُ كَفَّارَةٌ لِمَا بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي تَلِيهَا وَزِيَادَةُ ثَلَاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ، وَذَلِكَ لأَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى قَالَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">»</div><p>(Friday (prayer) to the next Friday (preayer), plus three more days, erase whatever was committed (of sins) between them. This is because Allah says: Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit) Abu Dharr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ صَامَ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ مِنْ كُلِّ شَهْرٍ فَقَدْ صَامَ الدَّهْرَ كُلَّه»</div><p>(Whoever fasts three days every month, will have fasted all the time.) Ahmad, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith, and this is Ahmad's wording.

Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, (he was a) Hanif, and he was not of the Mushrikin\") 16:120-123. Ordering the Prophet to follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanifiyyah, does not mean that Prophet Ibrahim reached more perfection in it than our Prophet . Rather, our Prophet perfectly established the religion and it was completed for him; and none before him reached this level of perfection. This is why he is the Final Prophet, the chief of all the Children of Adam who holds the station of praise and glory, the honor of intercession on the Day of Resurrection. All creation (on that Day) will seek him, even Ibrahim the friend of Allah, peace be upon him to request the beginning of Judgement.

Allah said in a similar statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ </div><p>(Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.) 108:2, meaning, make your prayer and sacrifice for Allah alone. As for the idolators, they used to worship the idols and sacrifice to them, so Allah commanded the Prophet to defy them and contradict their practices. Allah, the Exalted, commanded him to dedicate his intention and heart to being sincere for Him alone.

Cause me to die as a Muslim, and join me with the righteous.) 12:101 Musa said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ مُوسَى يقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ ءامَنْتُمْ بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُواْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ - فَقَالُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ - وَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الْكَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(And Musa said: \"O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.\" They said: \"In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers. And save us by your mercy from the disbelieving folk\") 10:84-86 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ</div><p>(Verily, We did send down the Tawrah, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests did also.) 5:44, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى الْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ ءَامِنُواْ بِى وَبِرَسُولِى قَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(And when I (Allah) inspired Al-Hawariyyun (the disciples) of `Isa to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: \"We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.\") 5:111 Therefore, Allah states that He sent all His Messengers with the religion of Islam, although their respective laws differed from each other, and some of them abrogated others. Later on, the Law sent with Muhammad abrogated all previous laws and nothing will ever abrogate it, forever. Certainly, Muhammad's Law will always be apparent and its flags raised high, until the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet said, C </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ دِينُنَا وَاحِد»</div><p>(We, the Prophets, are half brothers, but our religion is one.) Half brothers, mentioned in the Hadith, refers to the brothers to one father, but different mothers. Therefore, the religion, representing the one father, is one; worshipping Allah alone without partners, even though the laws which are like the different mothers in this parable, are different. Allah the Most High knows best. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said that when the Messenger of Allah used to start the prayer with Takbir saying, \"Allahu Akbar\" (Allah is the Great) he would then supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِين»</div><p>(I have directed my face towards He Who has created the heavens and earth, Hanifan and I am not among the Mushrikin. Certainly, my prayer, sacrifice, living and dying are all for Allah, Lord of the worlds.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الْمَلِكُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَنْتَ رَبِّي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي وَاعْتَرَفْتُ بِذَنْبِي فَاغْفِرْ لِي ذُنُوبِي جَمِيعًا لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، وَاهْدِنِي لِأَحْسَنِ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَهْدِي لِأَحْسَنِهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ، وَاصْرِفْ عَنِّي سَيِّئَهَا لَا يَصْرِفُ عَنِّي سَيِّئَهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ، تَبَارَكْتَ وَتَعَالَيْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْك»</div><p>(O Allah! You are the King, there is no deity worthy of worship except You. You are my Lord and I am Your servant. I have committed wrong against myself and admitted to my error, so forgive me all my sins. Verily, You, only You forgive the sins. (O Allah!) Direct me to the best conduct, for none except You directs to the best conduct. Divert me from the worst conduct, for only You divert from the worst conduct. Glorified and Exalted You are. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You.) This Hadith, which was also recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, continues and mentions the Prophet's supplication in his bowing, prostrating and final sitting positions. </p>"

This Ayah commands sincerely trusting Allah, while the Ayah before it commands sincerely worshipping Allah alone without partners. These two meanings are often mentioned together in the Qur'an. Allah directs His servants to proclaim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </div><p>(You (alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).) 1:5 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(So worship Him and put your trust in Him.) 11:123, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا</div><p>(Say: \"He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust\".) 67:29, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً </div><p>(Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him a guardian.) 73:9 There are similar Ayat on this subject. </p><h2>Every Person Carries His Own Burden</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلاَّ عَلَيْهَا وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</div><p>(No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.) thus emphasizing Allah's reckoning, decision and justice that will occur on the Day of Resurrection. The souls will only be recompensed for their deeds, good for good and evil for evil. No person shall carry the burden of another person, a fact that indicates Allah's perfect justice. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</div><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.) 35:18, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً</div><p>(Then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment (of his reward).) 20:112 Scholars of Tafsir commented, \"No person will be wronged by carrying the evil deeds of another person, nor will his own good deeds be curtailed or decreased.\" Allah also said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ </div><p>(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned. Except those on the Right.) 74:38-39, meaning, every person will be tied to his evil deeds. But, for those on the right -- the believers -- the blessing of their good works will benefit their offspring and relatives, as well. Allah said in Surat At-Tur, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</div><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) 52:21, meaning, We shall elevate their offspring to their high grades in Paradise, even though the deeds of the offspring were less righteous, since they shared faith with them in its general form. Allah says, We did not decrease the grades of these righteous believers so that those (their offspring and relatives) who have lesser grades, can share the same grades as them. Rather Allah elevated the lesser believers to the grades of their parents by the blessing of their parents' good works, by His favor and bounty. Allah said next (in Surat At-Tur), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</div><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) 52:21, meaning, of evil. Allah's statement here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ مَّرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ</div><p>(Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.) means, work you (disbelievers), and we will also work. Surely, both you and us will be gathered to Allah and He will inform us of our deeds and your deeds and the decision on what we used to dispute about in the life of this world. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لاَّ تُسْـَلُونَ عَمَّآ أَجْرَمْنَا وَلاَ نُسْـَلُ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ - قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِالْحَقِّ وَهُوَ الْفَتَّاحُ الْعَلِيمُ </div><p>(Say: \"You will not be asked about our sins, nor shall we be asked of what you do.\" Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs.\") 34:25-26. </p>"

Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth) 43:60, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ حُلَفَآءَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And makes you inheritors of the Earth, generations after generations.) 27:62, and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِى الأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً</div><p>(Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.) 2:30, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act.) 7:129 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَـتٍ</div><p>(And He has raised you in ranks, some above others,) means, He has made you different from each other with regards to provision, conduct, qualities, evilness, shapes, color of skin, and so forth, and He has the perfect wisdom in all this. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَـتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so that some may employ others in their work.) 43:32, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَـتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلاً </div><p>(See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.) 17:21 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَـكُم</div><p>(that He may try you in that which He has bestowed on you.) means, so that He tests you in what He has granted you, for Allah tries the rich concerning his wealth and will ask him about how he appreciated it. He also tries the poor concerning his poverty and will ask him about his patience with it. Muslim recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الدُّنْيَا حُلْوَةٌ خَضِرَةٌ وَإِنَّ اللهَ مُسْتَخْلِفُكُمْ فِيهَا فَنَاظِرٌ مَاذَا تَعْمَلُونَ، فَاتَّقُوا الدُّنْيَا وَاتَّقُوا النِّسَاءَ فَإِنَّ أَوَّلَ فِتْنَةِ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ كَانَتْ فِي النِّسَاء»</div><p>(Verily, this life is beautiful and green, and Allah made you dwell in it generation after generation so that He sees what you will do. Therefore, beware of this life and beware of women, for the first trial that the Children of Israel suffered from was with women.) Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ الْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Surely, your Lord is swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) this is both discouragement and encouragement, by reminding the believers that Allah is swift in reckoning and punishment with those who disobey Him and defy His Messengers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(And certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) for those who take Him as protector and follow His Messengers in the news and commandments they conveyed. Allah often mentions these two attributes together in the Qur'an. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</div><p>(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment) 13:6, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَبِّىءْ عِبَادِى أَنِّى أَنَا الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ - وَأَنَّ عَذَابِى هُوَ الْعَذَابُ الاٌّلِيمُ </div><p>(Declare unto My servants, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) 15:49-50 There are similar Ayat that contain encouragement and discouragement. Sometimes Allah calls His servants to Him with encouragement, describing Paradise and making them eager for what He has with Him. Sometimes, He calls His servants with discouragement, mentioning the Fire and its torment and punishment, as well as, the Day of Resurrection and its horrors. Sometimes Allah mentions both so that each person is affected by it according to his or her qualities. We ask Allah that He makes us among those who obey what He has commanded, avoid what He has prohibited, and believe in Him as He has informed. Certainly, He is Near, hears and answers the supplication, and He is the Most Kind, Generous and Bestowing. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ مَا عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الْعُقُوبَةِ مَا طَمِعَ بِجَنَّتِهِ أَحَدٌ، وَلَوْ يَعْلَمُ الْكَافِرُ مَااِعنْدَ اللهِ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ مَا قَنَطَ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، خَلَقَ اللهُ مِائَةَ رَحْمَةٍ فَوَضَعَ وَاحِدَةً بَيْنَ خَلْقِهِ يَتَرَاحَمُونَ بِهَا وَعِنْدَ اللهِ تِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُون»</div><p>(If the believer knew Allah's punishment, no one will hope in entering His Paradise. And if the disbeliever knew Allah's mercy, no one will feel hopeless of acquiring Paradise. Allah created a hundred kinds of mercy. He sent down one of them to His creation, and they are merciful to each other on that account. With Allah, there remains ninety-nine kinds of mercy.) Muslim and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, At-Tirmidhi said \"Hasan\". Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَمَّا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْخَلْقَ كَتَبَ فِي كِتَابٍ فَهُوَ عِنْدَهُ فَوْقَ الْعَرْشِ إِنَّ رَحْمَتِي تَغْلِبُ غَضَبِي»</div><p>(When Allah created the creation, He wrote in a Book, and this Book is with Him above the Throne: `My mercy overcomes My anger.') This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-An`am, all the thanks and appreciation for Allah.</p>"
