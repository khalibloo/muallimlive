As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears, and for them it is blindness. Such people are being called from a distant place.\"  (1). This verse was revealed in answer to an objection raised by some people of Quraish who, according to a report of Sa'id Ibn Jubair reproduced by Suyuti in his Ad-Durr-ul-Manthur, had said that some part of the Qur'an should have been in a language other than Arabic, so that its miraculous nature would have been more pronounced in the sense that an Arab prophet would have been reciting verses in a language he did not know. The gist of the answer given in this verse is that there is no end to such absurd objections. Had Allah revealed the Qur'an in some other language, they would have come with another objection that it is not understandable, and that an Arab messenger is not supposed to convey his message in any language other than Arabic."
