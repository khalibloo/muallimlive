They further said that had he really been a prophet, he would have delivered discourses in a strange language with the help of God. Non-serious and insincere people alone indulge in such talk, and such people can never be satisfied. For example, if it had happened that the prophet had approached the Arab people and started talking to them in Greek or Syriac or Persian language, the people would have had grounds for saying; ‘How strange is this prophet! He says that he has come to guide the people, but he speaks in a language which is not understood by his audience.’ The fact is that only those people are able to accept the Truth who are serious about it. Those who are not serious about the Truth are unable to understand even the clearest of its points.  The analogy befitting them is that of a person who is called from a very far-off place. Such a person will hear some voice, but he will be unable to make out its real sense.</p>"
