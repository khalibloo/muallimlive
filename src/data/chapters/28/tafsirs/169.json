      "text": "<h2>How Musa's Mother was inspired and shown what to do</h2><p>It was mentioned that when Fir`awn killed so many of the males of the Children of Israel, the Copts were scared that the Children of Israel would die out, and they themselves would have to do the heavy labor that the Children of Israel used to do. So they said to Fir`awn, \"If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it.\" So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet.

When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features.

Ibn Jurayj narrated from `Ata' Al-Khurasani, from Ibn `Abbas, \"That was between Maghrib and `Isha'.\" Ibn Al-Munkadir narrated from `Ata' bin Yasar from Ibn `Abbas, \"That was in the middle of the day.\" This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلاَنِ</div><p>(and he found there two men fighting,) meaning, hitting one another and struggling with one another.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا مِن شِيعَتِهِ</div><p>(one of his party, ) meaning, an Israelite,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهَـذَا مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</div><p>(and the other of his foes.) meaning, a Coptic. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Muhammad bin Ishaq. The Israelite man asked Musa, peace be upon him, for help, and Musa took advantage of the fact that people were not paying attention, so he went to the Coptic man and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَى فَقَضَى عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(so Musa struck him with his fist and he died.) Mujahid said, \"This means he punched him with his fist.\" And then he died.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>(He said) refers to Musa.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَدَخَلَ الْمَدِينَةَ عَلَى حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلاَنِ هَـذَا مِن شِيعَتِهِ وَهَـذَا مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَاسْتَغَـثَهُ الَّذِى مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِى مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَى فَقَضَى عَلَيْهِ قَالَ هَـذَا مِنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ إِنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ مُّضِلٌّ مُّبِينٌ - قَالَ رَب إِنِّى ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِى فَاغْفِرْ لِى فَغَفَرَ لَهُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ</div><p>(\"This is of Shaytan's doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.\" He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.\" Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. He said: \"My Lord! For that with which You have favored me,) meaning, `what You have given me of prestige, power and blessings -- '</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَنْ أَكُونَ ظَهِيراً</div><p>(I will nevermore be a helper of the criminals!) `those who disbelieve in You and go against Your commands.'</p>"

Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy.).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُنكِحَكَ إِحْدَى ابْنَتَىَّ هَاتَيْنِ</div><p>(I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you,) means, this old man asked him to take care of his flocks, then he would marry one of his two daughters to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى أَن تَأْجُرَنِى ثَمَانِىَ حِجَجٍ فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْراً فَمِنْ عِندِكَ</div><p>(on condition that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten years, it will be (a favor) from you.) meaning, `on the condition that you tend my flocks for eight years, and if you want to give me two extra years, that is up to you, but if you do not want to, then eight years is enough.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ سَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ</div><p>(But I intend not to place you under a difficulty. If Allah wills, you will find me one of the righteous.) means, `I do not want to put pressure on you or cause you any inconvenience or argue with you.' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Rabah Al-Lakhmi said, \"I heard `Utbah bin An-Nadar As-Sulami, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah narrating that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ آجَرَ نَفْسَهُ بِعِفَّةِ فَرْجِهِ وَطُعْمَةِ بَطْنِه»</div><p>(Musa, peace be upon him, hired himself out for the purpose of keeping chaste and to feed himself.) And Allah tells us about Musa, peace be upon him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ ذَلِكَ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ أَيَّمَا الاٌّجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ </div><p>(He said: \"That (is settled) between me and you: whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.\") Musa said to his father-in-law, \"The matter is as you say. You have hired me for eight years, and if I complete ten years, that is my choice, but if I do the lesser amount, I will still have fulfilled the covenant and met the conditions.\" So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَّمَا الاٌّجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ</div><p>(whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me,) meaning, `there will be no blame on me. The complete term is permissible but it is still regarded as something extra.' This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him) (2:203). And the Messenger of Allah said to Hamzah bin `Amr Al-Aslami, may Allah be pleased with him, who used to fast a great deal and who asked him about fasting while traveling:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنْ شِئْتَ فَصُمْ، وَإِنْ شِئْتَ فَأَفْطِر»</div><p>(If you wish, then fast, and if you wish, do not fast.) even though it is better to fast, according to the evidence of other reports. And there is evidence which indicates that Musa, peace be upon him, fulfilled the longer of the two terms. Al-Bukhari recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A Jew from the people of Hirah asked me; `Which of the two terms did Musa fulfill' I said, `I do not know until I go to the scholar of the Arabs and ask him.' So I went to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and asked him. He said: `He fulfilled the longer and better of them, for when a Messenger of Allah said he would do a thing, he did it.\"' This is how it was recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p>"

This indicates that when Musa headed for the fire, he headed in the direction of the Qiblah with the western mountain on his right. He found the fire burning in a green bush on the side of the mountain adjoining the valley, and he stood there amazed at what he was seeing. Then his Lord called him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ</div><p>(from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(O Musa!

When he saw that:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</div><p>(he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing.

Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease.

      "text": "<h2>Musa's Return to Egypt and how he was honored with the Mission and Miracles on the Way</h2><p>In the explanation of the previous Ayah, we have already seen that Musa completed the longer and better of the two terms, which may also be understood from the Ayah where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا قَضَى مُوسَى الاٌّجَلَ</div><p>(Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term,) meaning, the longer of the two; and Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ</div><p>(and was traveling with his family,) They said: \"Musa missed his country and his relatives, so he resolved to visit them in secret, without Fir`awn and his people knowing. So he gathered up his family and the flocks which his father-in-law had given to him, and set out on a cold, dark, rainy night. They stopped to camp, and whenever he tried to start a fire, he did not succeed. He was surprised by this, and while he was in this state,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ءَانَسَ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ نَاراً</div><p>(he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur) he saw a fire burning from a far.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالَ لاًّهْلِهِ امْكُثُواْ إِنِّى ءَانَسْتُ نَاراً</div><p>(He said to his family: \"Wait, I have seen a fire...\") meaning, `wait while I go there, '</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّعَلِّى ءَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</div><p>(perhaps I may bring to you from there some information,) This was because they lost their way.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</div><p>(or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves.) so that they could get warm and find relief from the cold.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ أَتَـهَا نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ</div><p>(So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley,) From the side of the valley that adjoined the mountain on his right, to the west. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ</div><p>(And you were not on the western side, when We made clear to Musa the commandment) (20:44). This indicates that when Musa headed for the fire, he headed in the direction of the Qiblah with the western mountain on his right. He found the fire burning in a green bush on the side of the mountain adjoining the valley, and he stood there amazed at what he was seeing. Then his Lord called him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ</div><p>(from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exits!) meaning, `the One Who is addressing you and speaking to you is the Lord of all that exits, the One Who does what He wills, the One apart from Whom there is no other god or lord, may He be exalted and sanctified, the One Who by His very nature, attributes, words and deeds is far above any resemblance to His creation, may He be glorified.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ</div><p>(And throw your stick!) `the stick that is in your hand' -- as was stated in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى </div><p>(\"And what is that in your right hand, O Musa\" He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.\") (20:17-18). The meaning is: `this stick, which you know so well;'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ أَلْقِهَا يمُوسَى - فَأَلْقَـهَا فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَى </div><p>(\"Cast it down, O Musa!\" He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.) (20:19-20). Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, \"Be!\" and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّى مُدْبِراً</div><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</div><p>(he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يمُوسَى أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الاٌّمِنِينَ</div><p>(O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.) he came back to his original position. Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease;) meaning, `when you put your hand in your garment and then draw it out, it will be shining white as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of lightning.' Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(without a disease) i.e., with no trace of leukoderma.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ</div><p>(and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear.)

If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease. These were two clear and definitive proofs of the power of the One Who does as He chooses, and of the truth of the prophethood of the one at whose hands these miracles occurred.

This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger!

And here, after telling the story of Musa from beginning to end and how Allah began His revelation to him and spoke with him, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ</div><p>(And you were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Musa the commandment,) meaning, `you -- O Muhammad -- were not on the western side of the mountain where Allah spoke to Musa from the tree which was to the east of it, in the valley.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كنتَ مِنَ الشَّـهِدِينَ</div><p>(and you were not among the witnesses.) `to that event, but Allah has revealed this to you,' so that it may be evidence and proof of events which happened centuries ago, for people have forgotten the evidence that Allah established against them and what was revealed to the earlier Prophets.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ ثَاوِياً فِى أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا</div><p>(And you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting Our Ayat to them.) meaning, `you were not living among the people of Madyan reciting Our Ayat to them, when you started to tell about Our Prophet Shu`ayb and what he said to his people and how they responded.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ</div><p>(But it is We Who kept sending. ) means, `but We revealed that to you and sent you to mankind as a Messenger.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنْتَ بِجَانِبِ الطُّورِ إِذْ نَادَيْنَا</div><p>(And you were not at the side of At-Tur when We called.)

This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى</div><p>(And (remember) when your Lord called Musa) (26:10).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى </div><p>(When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa) (79:16).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَـدَيْنَـهُ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ الاٌّيْمَنِ وَقَرَّبْنَاهُ نَجِيّاً </div><p>(And We called him from the right side of At-Tur, and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him) (19:52).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord,) means, `you were not a witness to any of those things, but Allah has revealed them to you and told you about them as a mercy from Him to you and to His servants, by sending you to them,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may remember or receive admonition.) means, `so that they may be guided by that which you bring from Allah.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلا أَن تُصِيبَهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</div><p>(And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah) -- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they would have said: \"Our Lord! Why did You not send us a Messenger) meaning: `and We have sent you to them to establish proof against them, and to give them no excuse when the punishment of Allah comes to them because of their disbelief, lest they offer the excuse that no Messenger or warner came to them.' This is like what Allah says about the situation after He revealed His blessed Book the Qur'an:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن تَقُولُواْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ الْكِتَـبُ عَلَى طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَـفِلِينَ أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَـبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ</div><p>(Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So, now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy) (6:156-157).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رُّسُلاً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</div><p>(Messengers as bearers of good news as well as warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers) (4:165).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَى فَتْرَةٍ مَّنَ الرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا جَآءَنَا مِن بَشِيرٍ وَلاَ نَذِيرٍ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ</div><p>(O People of the Scripture!

And He knows best those who are the guided.) meaning: Allah knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be misguided. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that this Ayah was revealed concerning Abu Talib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah . He used to protect the Prophet, support him and stand by him. He loved the Prophet dearly, but this love was a natural love, i.e., born of kinship, not a love that was born of the fact that he was the Messenger of Allah . When he was on his deathbed, the Messenger of Allah called him to Faith and to enter Islam, but the decree overtook him and he remained a follower of disbelief, and Allah's is the complete wisdom.

This is like the Ayah where Allah describes a believer in Paradise looking out at his companion who is in Hell, and saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ </div><p>(Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).) (37:57) And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ</div><p>(but the Jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him)) (37:158).</p>"

It was recorded that a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good -- is this a kind of arrogance\" The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَال»</div><p>(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty...) And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ</div><p>(Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا</div><p>(he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant -- how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) \"Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do\") (27: 90). This is the postition of generosity and justice.</p>"

Al-`Awfi also reported from Ibn `Abbas that the phrase:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ</div><p>(will surely bring you back to the return.) means, \"will surely bring you back to Makkah as He brought you out of it.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Mujahid commented on:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ</div><p>(will surely bring you back to the return.) He said, \"Back to your place of birth in Makkah.\" Ibn `Abbas is also reported to have interpreted it variously referring to death, to the Day of Resurrection which will come after death, and to Paradise which will be his reward and his destiny for putting the Message of Allah into practice and conveying it to the humans and Jinns, and because he is the most perfect, most eloquent and most noble of all the creation of Allah. Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل رَّبِّى أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(Say: \"My Lord is Aware of him who brings guidance, and of him who is in manifest error.\") means: \"Say, O Muhammad, to those among your people who oppose you and disbelieve you, among the idolators and those who follow them in their disbelief, `My Lord knows best which of us, you or I, is rightly guided, and you will come to know for which of us will be the (happy) end in the Hereafter, and for which of us will be a good end and victory in this world and in the Hereafter'.\" Then Allah reminds His Prophet the numerous blessings He granted to him and mankind by virtue of sending him to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُو أَن يُلْقَى إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبُ</div><p>(And you were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you,) `Before the revelation was sent down to you, you did not expect that revelation would be sent down to you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(but it is a mercy from your Lord.) means, `but revelation has been sent down to you from Allah as a mercy to you and to mankind because of you. Since Allah has granted you this great blessing,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً</div><p>(So never be a supporter) i.e., a helper,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(of the disbelievers.) rather, separate from them, `express your hostility towards them and oppose them. '</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ</div><p>(And let them not turn you away from the Ayat of Allah after they have been sent down to you.) meaning, `Do not let their opposition to you affect you or put people off from following your way; do not worry about that or pay any attention to it, for Allah will make your word supreme, will support your religion and will make the Message with which He has sent you prevail over all other religions.' So He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ</div><p>(and invite to your Lord) to worship your Lord Alone, with no partners or associates,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكَينَ</div><p>(and be not of idolators.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(And invoke not any other god along with Allah, there is no God but Him.) means, it is not appropriate to worship anything or anybody except Him, and divinity does not befit any except His glory.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ</div><p>(Everything will perish save His Face.) Here Allah is telling us that He is Eternal, Ever Lasting, Ever Living, Self-Sustaining, Who, although His creation dies, He will never die, as He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ </div><p>(Whatsoever is on it will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever.) (55:26-27). Allah used the word \"Face\" to refer to Himself, as He says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ</div><p>(Everything will perish save His Face.) meaning, everything except Him. It was reported in the Sahih via Abu Salamah that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَصْدَقُ كَلِمَةٍ قَالَهَا الشَّاعِرُ لَبِيدُ أَلَا كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مَا خَلَا اللهَ بَاطِلُ »</div><p>(The truest word of a poet was the saying of Labid - indeed everything except Allah is false.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ الْحُكْمُ</div><p>(His is the decision,) means, dominion and control, and there is none who can reverse His judgement or decision.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Him you shall be returned.) means, on the Day when you will be brought back, and He will reward or punish you according to your deeds: if they are good, then you will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then you will be punished. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qasas. To Allah be praise and blessings.</p>"
