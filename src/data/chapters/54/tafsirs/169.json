The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon</h2><p>Allah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</div><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ </div><p>(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)</p><h2>Hadiths about the Last Hour</h2><p>There are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah gave a speech to his Companions, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»</div><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, \"We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.\" Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا أَعْمَارُكُمْ فِي أَعْمَارِ مَنْ مَضَى إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ فِيمَا مَضَى»</div><p>(What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ هكَذَا»</div><p>(I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ أَنَا وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهذِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ، إِنْ كَادَتْ لَتَسْبِقُنِي»</div><p>(I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, \"Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتُمْ وَالسَّاعَةُ كَهَاتَيْن»</div><p>(You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)\"' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ</div><p>(and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger , according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split</p><h2>The Narration of Anas bin Malik</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ </div><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.</p><h2>The Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\"' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il.</p><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ - وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ </div><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") \"This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.\"</p><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr</h2><p>Al-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ </div><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) \"This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ اشْهَد»</div><p>(O Allah! Be witness.)\" This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اشْهَدُوا»</div><p>(Be witnesses.)\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, \"The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger and I saw the mount between its two parts.</p><h2>The Stubbornness of the idolators</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً</div><p>(And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُعْرِضُواْ</div><p>(they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ</div><p>(and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir.\") They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَّبُواْ وَاتَّبَعُواْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ</div><p>(And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, \"will settle according to its people.\" Mujahid commented on the meaning of,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ</div><p>(And every matter will be settled.) by saying, \"On the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْبَاءِ </div><p>(And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ</div><p>(wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حِكْمَةٌ بَـلِغَةٌ</div><p>(Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا تُغْنِـى النُّذُرُ</div><p>(but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts.

The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon</h2><p>Allah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</div><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ </div><p>(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)</p><h2>Hadiths about the Last Hour</h2><p>There are several Hadiths with this meaning.

This is why Allah destroyed them with a type of torment that He never inflicted upon any nation before them. Allah the Exalted commanded Jibril, peace be upon him, to raise their cities to the sky and then turn them upside down over them, followed by stones made of marked Sijjil. So He said here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حَـصِباً إِلاَّ آلَ لُوطٍ نَّجَّيْنَـهُم بِسَحَرٍ </div><p>(Verily, We sent against them Hasib (a violent storm of stones) except the family of Lut, them We saved in the last hour of the night.)

Lut hosted his guests, while his wife, the evil old one, sent a message to her people informing them of Lut's guests. They came to him in haste from every direction, and Lut had to close the door in their faces. They came during the night and tried to break the door; Lut tried to fend them off, while shielding his guests from them, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـؤُلآءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ</div><p>(These are my daughters, if you must act (so).)

They went back feeling for the walls to guide them, threatening Lut with what would befall him in the morning. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ صَبَّحَهُم بُكْرَةً عَذَابٌ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ </div><p>(And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.) meaning, a torment that they had no way of escaping or avoiding,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِى وَنُذُرِ وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ </div><p>(Then taste you My torment and My warnings. And indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember)</p>"

There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</div><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</div><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you.

This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</div><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</div><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ </div><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</div><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى </div><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ </div><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ </div><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ </div><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»</div><p>(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ </div><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»</div><p>(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»</div><p>(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.)
