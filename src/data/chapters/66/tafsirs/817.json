      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">In the present world man has been kept in trial conditions and as such he is liable to commit errors. In compensation for this, he must turn towards God in repentance.  In essence, true repentance comes from a sense of shame. If a man fully realises his mistake, he will feel ashamed, and this sense of shame will compel him not to indulge in such action in future. That is why a hadith says, ‘Being ashamed is repentance.’ A companion of the Prophet Muhammad said, ‘True repentance is a man turning towards God and then not repeating that action.’  Repentance has to be borne out by actions. It is not just the repetition of some words. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib saw an individual who, after making a mistake, was simply repeating the words ‘tawbah, tawbah’. ‘Ali said that this was repentance of liars. True tawbah is the light of the Hereafter and false tawbah is the darkness of the Hereafter.</p>"
