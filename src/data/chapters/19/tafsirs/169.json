      "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded a Hadith of Umm Salamah in his Sirah, and Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from Ibn Mas`ud, the story of the Hijrah (migration) to Ethiopia from Makkah. The narration mentions that Ja`far bin Abi Talib recited the first part of this Surah to An-Najashi and his companions.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Story of Zakariyya and His Supplication for a Son The discussion about the separate letters has already preceded at the beginning ofSurat Al-Baqarah.</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(A reminder of the mercy of your Lord) This means that this is a reminder of Allah's mercy upon His servant Zakariyya. Yahya bin Ya`mar recited it, (ذَكَّرَ رَحْمَةَ رَبكَ عبدَه زكريا) \"He has reminded of your Lord's mercy to His servant Zakariyya.\" The word Zakariyya in the Ayah has been recited with elongation and also shortened. Both recitations are well-known. He was a great Prophet from the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded that the Prophet said about Zakariyya that He was a carpenter who used to eat from what he earned with his own hand through carpentry. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً </div><p>(When he called his Lord with a call in secret.) He only made his supplication secretly because it is more beloved to Allah. This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً </div><p>(When he called out his Lord with a call in secret. ) \"Verily, Allah knows the pious heart and he hears the hidden voice.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّى</div><p>(He said: \"My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble...\") meaning, \"I have become weak and feeble in strength.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْباً</div><p>(and gray hair has Ashta`al on my head,) means the gray hair has burned into the black hair. The intent is to inform of weakness and old age, and its external and internal traces. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً</div><p>(and I have never been unblessed in my invocation to You, O my Lord!) This means, \"I have not experienced from You except that You would respond to my supplication and that You would never refuse me in whatever I ask of You.\" Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِىَ مِن وَرَآئِى</div><p>(And verily, I fear Mawali after me,) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, \"In saying the word Mawali, he (Zakariyya) meant his succeeding relatives.\" The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his prophethood and that which was revealed to him. In response to this I would like to point out that he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two Sahihs, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</div><p>(We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) In a narration recorded by At-Tirmidhi with an authentic chain of narrations, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَث»</div><p>(We, Prophets do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth).) Therefore, the meaning in these Hadiths restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاًيَرِثُنِى</div><p>(So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me,) inheritance of prophethood. For this reason Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</div><p>(and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</div><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.)27:16 This means that he inherited prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth. It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father. Therefore, if this was not referring to a specific type of inheritance, then Allah would not have mentioned it. All of this is supported and affirmed by what is in the authentic Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</div><p>(We Prophets do not leave behind any inheritance (of wealth).

Both recitations are well-known. He was a great Prophet from the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded that the Prophet said about Zakariyya that He was a carpenter who used to eat from what he earned with his own hand through carpentry.

This means, \"I have not experienced from You except that You would respond to my supplication and that You would never refuse me in whatever I ask of You.\" Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِىَ مِن وَرَآئِى</div><p>(And verily, I fear Mawali after me,) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, \"In saying the word Mawali, he (Zakariyya) meant his succeeding relatives.\" The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his prophethood and that which was revealed to him. In response to this I would like to point out that he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two Sahihs, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</div><p>(We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth).

It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father.

This Ayah is similar to what Allah, the Exalted, said in Surah Al `Imran,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ اجْعَل لِّى ءَايَةً قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ النَّاسَ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزًا وَاذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيرًا وَسَبِّحْ بِالْعَشِىِّ وَالإِبْكَـرِ </div><p>(He said: \"O my Lord! Make a sign for me.\" (Allah) said \"Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much, and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.)3:41 This is a proof that he did not speak to his people for these three nights and their days as well.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ رَمْزًا</div><p>(except with signals.) Meaning, with bodily gestures, this is why Allah says in this noble Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَخَرَجَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مِنَ الْمِحْرَابِ</div><p>(Then he came out to his people from the Mihrab) referring to the place where he was given the good news of the child.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(he indicated to them by signs) Meaning he made a gesture to them that was subtle and swift.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</div><p>(to glorify Allah in the morning and in the afternoon.) That they should be agreeable to what he was commanded to do during these three days, to increase in his deeds and gratitude to Allah for what He had given him. Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْحَى إِلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(he indicated to them by signs) \"He made a gesture.\" Wahb and Qatadah said the same.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Story of Maryam and Al-Masih (`Isa)</h2><p>After Allah, the Exalted, mentioned the story of Zakariyya, and that He blessed him with a righteous, purified and blessed child even in his old age while his wife was barren, He then mentions the story of Maryam. Allah informs of His granting her a child named `Isa without a father being involved (in her pregnancy). Between these two stories there is an appropriate and similar relationship. Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And mention in the Book, Maryam,) She was Maryam bint `Imran from the family lineage of Dawud. She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel. Allah mentioned the story of her mother's pregnancy with her in Surah Al `Imran, and that she (Maryam's mother) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah. This meant that she dedicated the child (Maryam) to the service of the Masjid of the Sacred House (in Jerusalem). Thus, they (Zakariyya, Maryam's mother and Maryam) were similar in that aspect.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner.)3:37 Thus, Maryam was raised among the Children of Israel in an honorable way. She was one of the female worshippers, well-known for her remarkable acts of worship, devotion and perseverance. She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time. He was a great man among them, whom they would refer to in their religious matters. Zakariyya saw astonishing miracles occur from her that amazed him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</div><p>(Every time Zakaiyya entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you got this\" She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides to whom He wills, without limit.) 3:37 It has been mentioned that he would find her with winter fruit during the summer and summer fruit during the winter. This has already been explained in Surah Al `Imran. Then, when Allah wanted to grant her His servant and Messenger, `Isa, one of the five Great Messengers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east.) 19:16 This means that she withdrew from them and secluded herself from them. She went to the eastern side of the Sacred Masjid (in Jerusalem). It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah's creation of why the Christians took the east as the direction of devotional worship. They did because of Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(When she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.)

Allah informs of His granting her a child named `Isa without a father being involved (in her pregnancy). Between these two stories there is an appropriate and similar relationship. Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things.

She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time.

Allah informs of His granting her a child named `Isa without a father being involved (in her pregnancy). Between these two stories there is an appropriate and similar relationship. Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And mention in the Book, Maryam,) She was Maryam bint `Imran from the family lineage of Dawud. She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel. Allah mentioned the story of her mother's pregnancy with her in Surah Al `Imran, and that she (Maryam's mother) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah. This meant that she dedicated the child (Maryam) to the service of the Masjid of the Sacred House (in Jerusalem). Thus, they (Zakariyya, Maryam's mother and Maryam) were similar in that aspect.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner.)3:37 Thus, Maryam was raised among the Children of Israel in an honorable way. She was one of the female worshippers, well-known for her remarkable acts of worship, devotion and perseverance. She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time. He was a great man among them, whom they would refer to in their religious matters. Zakariyya saw astonishing miracles occur from her that amazed him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</div><p>(Every time Zakaiyya entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you got this\" She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides to whom He wills, without limit.) 3:37 It has been mentioned that he would find her with winter fruit during the summer and summer fruit during the winter. This has already been explained in Surah Al `Imran. Then, when Allah wanted to grant her His servant and Messenger, `Isa, one of the five Great Messengers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east.) 19:16 This means that she withdrew from them and secluded herself from them. She went to the eastern side of the Sacred Masjid (in Jerusalem). It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah's creation of why the Christians took the east as the direction of devotional worship.

Therefore, she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.) She meant, \"If you fear Allah,\" as a means of reminding him of Allah. This is what is legislated in defense against (evil), so that it may be repulsed with ease. Therefore, the first thing she did was try to make him fear Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Ibn Jarir reported from `Asim that Abu Wa'il said when mentioning the story of Maryam, \"She knew that the pious person would refrain (from committing evil) when she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاًقَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.\" He said: \"I am only a messenger from your Lord...\") This means that the angel said to her in response, and in order to remove the fear that she felt within herself, \"I am not what you think, but I am the messenger of your Lord.\" By this he meant, \"Allah has sent me to you.\" It is said that when she mentioned the (Name of the) Most Beneficent (Ar-Rahman), Jibril fell apart and returned to his true form (as an angel). He responded, (إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِيَهَب لَكِ غُلَـمًا زَكِيًّا) `I am only a messenger from your Lord, to provide to you the gift of a righteous son.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلَـمٌ</div><p>(She said: \"How can I have a son...\") This means that Maryam was amazed at this. She said, \"How can I have a son\" She said this to mean, \"In what way would a son be born to me when I do not have a husband and I do not commit any wicked acts (i.e. fornication)\" For this reason she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيّاً</div><p>(when no man has touched me, nor am I Baghiyya) The Baghiyy is a female fornicator.

Verily, He is Most Able to do whatever He wills.\" Due to this, he (Jibril) conveyed Allah's Words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</div><p>(And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) This means a proof and a sign for mankind of the power of their Maker and Creator, Who diversified them in their creation. He created their father, Adam, without a male (father) or female (mother). Then, He created Hawwa' (Adam's spouse) from a male (father) without a female (mother). Then, He created the rest of their progeny from male and female, except `Isa. He caused `Isa to be born from a female without a male. Thus, Allah completed the four types of creation (of the human being), which proves the perfection of His power and the magnificence of His authority. There is no god worthy of worship except Him and there is no true Lord other than Him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا</div><p>(and a mercy from Us,) This means, \"We will make this boy a mercy from Allah and a Prophet from among the Prophets.

For this reason, a Hadith has been reported prohibiting the money earned from Baghiyy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(He said: \"Thus said your Lord: `That is easy for Me (Allah)...\") This means that the angel said to her in response to her question, \"Verily, Allah has said that a boy will be born from you even though you do not have a husband and you have not committed any lewdness. Verily, He is Most Able to do whatever He wills.\" Due to this, he (Jibril) conveyed Allah's Words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</div><p>(And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) This means a proof and a sign for mankind of the power of their Maker and Creator, Who diversified them in their creation. He created their father, Adam, without a male (father) or female (mother). Then, He created Hawwa' (Adam's spouse) from a male (father) without a female (mother). Then, He created the rest of their progeny from male and female, except `Isa. He caused `Isa to be born from a female without a male. Thus, Allah completed the four types of creation (of the human being), which proves the perfection of His power and the magnificence of His authority. There is no god worthy of worship except Him and there is no true Lord other than Him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا</div><p>(and a mercy from Us,) This means, \"We will make this boy a mercy from Allah and a Prophet from among the Prophets. He will call to the worship of Allah and monotheistic belief in Him. This is as Allah, the Exalted, said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ قَالَتِ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ اسْمُهُ الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهًا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - وَيُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِى الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>((Remember) when the angels said: \"O Maryam! Verily, Allah gives you the good news of a Word from Him, his name will be Al-Masih, `Isa, the son of Maryam, held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah. And he will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.) 3:45-46 This means that he will call to the worship of his Lord in his cradle and while and adult. Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) This is the completion of Jibril's dialogue with Maryam. He informed her that this matter was preordained by Allah's power and will. Muhammad bin Ishaq said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) \"This means that Allah determined to do this, so there is no avoiding it.\"</p>"

This is so that she does not negate her oath itself,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً</div><p>(so I shall not speak to any human being today. ) Anas bin Malik commented on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ صَوْماً</div><p>(I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious) He said; \"A vow of silence.\" Likewise said Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. The meaning here is that in their Law, when fasting, it was forbidden for them to eat and speak. As-Suddi, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd have all stated this view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"When `Isa said to Maryam,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِى</div><p>(Grieve not) She said, `How can I not grieve when you are with me and I have no husband nor am I an owned slave woman What excuse do I have with the people Woe unto me, if I had only died before this, and had been a thing forgotten and unknown.' Then, `Isa said to her, `I will suffice you with a statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ البَشَرِ أَحَداً فَقُولِى إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً</div><p>(And if you see any human being, say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious so I shall not speak to any human being this day.')' All of this is from the speech of `Isa to his mother.\" Wahb said the same as well.</p>"

For this reason most of the reciters recited this Ayah with Qawlul-Haqq (statement of truth) as the subject, referring to `Isa himself. `Asim and `Abdullah bin `Amir both recited it Qawlal-Haqq (statement of truth) referring to the story in its entirety that the people differed about. It is reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited it as Qalal-Haqqa, which means that he (`Isa) said the truth. The recitation of the Ayah with the Qawlul-Haqq being the subject referring to `Isa, is the most apparent meaning grammatically. It has support for it in the statement of Allah after the story of `Isa,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ </div><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:60 When Allah mentioned that He created him as a servant and a Prophet, He extolled Himself, the Most Holy, by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ</div><p>(It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He.) Means glory be unto Him, He is far exalted above that which these ignorant, wrongdoing, transgressing people say about Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</div><p>(When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" -- and it is.) Whenever He wants something, He merely commands it and it happens as He wills. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ </div><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him: \"Be\" -- and he was. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:59-60</p><h2>`Isa commanded the Worship of Allah Alone, then the People differed after Him</h2><p>Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Among those things which `Isa said to his people while he was in his cradle is that Allah was his Lord and their Lord, and he commanded them to worship Him alone. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Meaning, \"That which I have come to you with from Allah is the straight path.\" This means that the path is correct; whoever follows it will be rightly guided and whoever opposes it will deviate and go astray. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</div><p>(Then the sects differed,) means that the opinions of the People of the Book differed concerning `Isa even after the explanation of his affair and the clarification of his situation. They disagreed about his being the servant of Allah, His Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam and a spirit from Himself. So a group of them -- who were the majority of the Jews (may Allah's curses be upon them) -- determined that he was a child of fornication and that his speaking in his cradle was merely sorcery. Another group said that it was Allah Who was speaking (not `Isa). Others said that he (`Isa) was the son of Allah. Some said that he was the third part of a divine trinity with Allah. Yet, others said that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. This latter view is the statement of truth, which Allah guided the believers to. A report similar with this meaning has been reported from `Amr bin Maymun, Ibn Jurayj, Qatadah and others from the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (later generations). Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) This is a threat and severe warning for those who lie about Allah, invent falsehood and claim that He (Allah) has a son. However, Allah has given them respite until the Day of Resurrection, and He has delayed their term out of gentleness and confident reliance upon His divine decree overcoming them. Verily, Allah does not hasten the affair of those who disobey Him. This has been related in a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</div><p>(Verily, Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then, the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful, (and) severe.) 11:102 In the Two Sahihs it is also reported that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ، إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</div><p>(No one is more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. Verily, they attribute to Him a son, while He is the One Who provides them sustenance and good health.) Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I punished it. And to me is the (final) return (of all).) 22:48 Allah, the Exalted, also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ </div><p>(Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 This is the reason that Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) referring to the Day of Resurrection. It has been related in an authentic Hadith that is agreed upon (in Al-Bukhari and Muslim), on the authority of `Ubadah bin As-Samit who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ شَهِدَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَأَنَّ عِيسَى عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَى مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ، وَأَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارَ حَقٌّ، أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنَ الْعَمَل»</div><p>(Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa was Allah's servant and Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam, and a spirit from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are both real, then Allah will admit him into Paradise regardless of whatever he did.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـكِنِ الظَّـلِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div>"

It has support for it in the statement of Allah after the story of `Isa,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ </div><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:60 When Allah mentioned that He created him as a servant and a Prophet, He extolled Himself, the Most Holy, by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ</div><p>(It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He.) Means glory be unto Him, He is far exalted above that which these ignorant, wrongdoing, transgressing people say about Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</div><p>(When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" -- and it is.) Whenever He wants something, He merely commands it and it happens as He wills. This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ </div><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him: \"Be\" -- and he was. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:59-60</p><h2>`Isa commanded the Worship of Allah Alone, then the People differed after Him</h2><p>Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Among those things which `Isa said to his people while he was in his cradle is that Allah was his Lord and their Lord, and he commanded them to worship Him alone. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Meaning, \"That which I have come to you with from Allah is the straight path.\" This means that the path is correct; whoever follows it will be rightly guided and whoever opposes it will deviate and go astray. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</div><p>(Then the sects differed,) means that the opinions of the People of the Book differed concerning `Isa even after the explanation of his affair and the clarification of his situation. They disagreed about his being the servant of Allah, His Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam and a spirit from Himself. So a group of them -- who were the majority of the Jews (may Allah's curses be upon them) -- determined that he was a child of fornication and that his speaking in his cradle was merely sorcery. Another group said that it was Allah Who was speaking (not `Isa). Others said that he (`Isa) was the son of Allah. Some said that he was the third part of a divine trinity with Allah. Yet, others said that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. This latter view is the statement of truth, which Allah guided the believers to. A report similar with this meaning has been reported from `Amr bin Maymun, Ibn Jurayj, Qatadah and others from the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (later generations). Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) This is a threat and severe warning for those who lie about Allah, invent falsehood and claim that He (Allah) has a son. However, Allah has given them respite until the Day of Resurrection, and He has delayed their term out of gentleness and confident reliance upon His divine decree overcoming them. Verily, Allah does not hasten the affair of those who disobey Him. This has been related in a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</div><p>(Verily, Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then, the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ </div><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful, (and) severe.) 11:102 In the Two Sahihs it is also reported that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ، إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</div><p>(No one is more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. Verily, they attribute to Him a son, while He is the One Who provides them sustenance and good health.) Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I punished it. And to me is the (final) return (of all).) 22:48 Allah, the Exalted, also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ </div><p>(Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 This is the reason that Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) referring to the Day of Resurrection. It has been related in an authentic Hadith that is agreed upon (in Al-Bukhari and Muslim), on the authority of `Ubadah bin As-Samit who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ شَهِدَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَأَنَّ عِيسَى عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَى مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ، وَأَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارَ حَقٌّ، أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنَ الْعَمَل»</div><p>(Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa was Allah's servant and Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam, and a spirit from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are both real, then Allah will admit him into Paradise regardless of whatever he did.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـكِنِ الظَّـلِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div>"

Ibn `Abbas and others said that Hafiyyan means, \"Kind.\" Meaning, \"since He guided me to worship Him and direct my religious devotion to Him alone.\" As-Suddi said, \"Al-Hafi is One Who is concerned with his (Ibrahim's) affair.\" Thus, Ibrahim sought forgiveness for his father for a very long time, even after he migrated to Ash-Sham. He continued to seek forgiveness for him even after building the Sacred Masjid (in Makkah) and after the birth of his two sons, Isma`il and Ishaq. This can be seen in his statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَالِدَىَّ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْحِسَابُ </div><p>(Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established.) 14:41 From this tradition, during the beginning stages of Islam, the Muslims used to seek forgiveness for their relatives and their family members who were polytheists. They did this following the way of Ibrahim, the Khalil (Friend) of Allah, until Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَءآؤاْ مِّنْكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said to their people: \"Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah.\") 60:4 Until Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ قَوْلَ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ لاّسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ وَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ مِن شَىْءٍ</div><p>(Except the saying of Ibrahim to his father: \"Verily, I will ask forgiveness (from Allah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah.\") 60:4 meaning, except for this statement, so do not follow it. Then Allah explains that Ibrahim abandoned this statement and retracted it. Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِىِّ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the idolators.) 9:113 Until Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَهِيمَ لاًّبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ </div><p>(And Ibrahim's invoking for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he is an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah, forbearing.) 9:114 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَأَدْعُو رَبِّى</div><p>(And I shall turn away from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah.

Thus, if these are the characteristics of the hypocrites, then behaving contrary to these is a characteristic of the true believer. For this reason, Allah commended His servant and Messenger Isma`il, for he was true to his promise. Likewise, the Messenger of Allah was true to his promise. He did not promise anyone anything, except that he fulfilled his promise to that person. He also commended Abu Al-`As bin Ar-Rabi`, the husband of his daughter Zaynab, by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«حَدَّثَنِي فَصَدَقَنِي، وَوَعَدَنِي فَوَفَى لِي»</div><p>(He spoke to me and he told me the truth, and he promised me and he fulfilled his promise to me.) When the Prophet died, the Khalifah (his successor), Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"Whoever received any promise from the Messenger of Allah or was owed any debt by him, then let him come to me and I will fulfill it on his behalf.\" So Jabir bin `Abdullah came and related that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ قَدْ جَاءَ مَالُ الْبَحْرَينِ أَعْطَيْتُكَ هَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا»</div><p>(If the wealth of Bahrain comes (to me), then I would give you such and such and such.) This meant that he would fill his hands with wealth. Therefore, when the wealth of Bahrain came (to them), Abu Bakr commanded Jabir to come and fill his hands from that wealth. Then, he commanded him to do so again, until he collected five hundred Dirhams. Then, Abu Bakr gave him its double along with it.(i.e. one thousand extra Dirhams). Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً</div><p>(and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet.) In this is a proof of Isma`il's favored status over his brother, Ishaq. Ishaq was only described as being a Prophet, but Isma`il was described with both prophethood and messengership.

Allah, the Exalted, said in this noble Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً</div><p>(When the Ayah of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping.) This means that when they heard the Words of Allah, mentioning His proofs and evidences, they prostrated to their Lord in humility, humbleness, praise and thanks for the great favors they were blessed with. The word Bukiyan at the end of the Ayah means those who are crying, and it is the plural of Baki. Due to this the scholars agree that it is legislated to prostrate upon reading this Ayah, in following them and adhering to their manner of worship.</p>"

Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, His promise must come to pass.) This affirms the fact that this will occur, and that it is a settled matter. Allah does not break His promise, nor does He change it. This is similar to His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَفْعُولاً</div><p>(His promise is certainly to be accomplished.) 73:18 This means that His promise will be and there is no avoiding it. Allah's statement here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَأْتِيّاً</div><p>(must come to pass.) This means that it will come to His servants who are striving towards it and they will reach it. There are those commentators who said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَأْتِيّاً</div><p>(must come to pass.) \"This means it is coming, because everything that comes to you, you also come to it. This is as the Arabs say, `Fifty years came to me, and I came to fifty years.' They both mean the same thing (I'm fifty years old).\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً</div><p>(They shall not hear therein any Laghw.) This means that in these gardens of Paradise there is no ignorant, wasteful and useless speech, like there is in this life. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ سَلَـماً</div><p>(...but only Salam.) This is an indifferent exception, similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً </div><p>(No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!) 56:25-26 Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</div><p>(And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) This means, in what is similar to mornings and evenings. This does not mean that there is a night and a day (in Paradise), but they will be living in times that alternate. They will know its lighted times from its lights and illumination. This is as Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ تَلِجُ الْجَنَّةَ صُوَرُهُمْ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ لَا يَبْصُقُونَ فِيهَا،وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ فِيهَا. وَلَايَتَغَوَّطُونَ، آنِيَتُهُمْ وَأَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ وَالْفِضَّةُ وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سَاقِهَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ، لَا اخْتِلَافَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَا تَبَاغُضَ، قُلُوبُهُمْ عَلَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، يُسَبِّحُونَ اللهَ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»</div><p>(The first group to enter into Paradise will have forms like the form of the moon on a night when it is full. They will not spit, nor will they blow their noses therein. They also will not defecate. Their containers and combs will be made of gold and silver and their censers will be of aloeswood. Their sweat will be the fragrance of musk and each of them will have two wives. The marrow of their shins will be visible from beneath the skin due to their beauty. They will not have any disputes between them, or any hatred. Their hearts will be united like the heart of one man. They will glorify Allah in the morning and evening.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim both recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الشُّهَدَاءُ عَلَى بَارِقِ نَهْرٍ بِبَابِ الْجَنَّةِ فِي قُبَّةٍ خَضْرَاءَ، يَخْرُجُ عَلَيْهِمْ رِزْقُهُمْ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»</div><p>(The martyrs will be upon the banks of a river by the gates of Paradise. Over them will be a green dome. Their sustenance will be brought out to them from Paradise, morning and evening.) Ahmad is the only one who collected this narration. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</div><p>(And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) \"This means the amount of time equal to night and day.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً </div><p>(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who had Taqwa.) This means, `This Paradise that We have described with these magnificent attributes, it is that which We will cause are pious servants to inherit.' They are those who obey Allah in happiness and times of hardship. They are those who suppress their anger and they pardon people's offenses. This is as Allah says at the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ </div><p>(Successful indeed are the believers. Those who are humble in their Salah.) 23:1-2 Until His saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ </div><p>(These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaws. In it they shall dwell forever.) 23:10-11</p>"

If you are true, then this supplication will not harm you.' But they refused to do so. An extensive discussion of this has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, and to Allah is the praise.

Therefore, Allah mentioned His arguments and proofs against the worship of `Isa, and that he was merely a creature like Adam. After this, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(Then whoever disputes with you about him after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say: \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the curse of Allah upon those who lie.\") 3:61 However, they (the Christians) also retreated from this challenge.</p>"

He then said to me, `Verily, if I die and am resurrected, and you come to me, I will also have abundance of wealth and children and I will repay you then.'

Holy is He and far Exalted is He above such description. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ</div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son.\" Indeed you have brought forth) This means, \"In this statement of yours.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَيْئاً إِدّاً</div><p>(a thing Idda.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik all said, \"Terrible.\" It has been said that it is pronounced Iddan, Addan, and Addan with elongation on the first vowel. All three of these pronunciations are known, but the most popular is the first. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً </div><p>(Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains Hadda, that they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious.) that is, out of their high esteem for Allah, when they hear this statement of wickedness coming from the Children of Adam. The reason for this is that these are creatures of Allah and they are established upon His Tawhid and the fact that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. He has no partners, no peer, no child, no mate and no coequal. Rather, He is the One, Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures are in need of. Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas said concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً </div><p>(Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains Hadda, that they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious.) \"Verily, the heavens, the earth, the mountains and all creatures -- except for humans and Jinns -- are frightened by the associating of partners with Allah. Creation will almost cease existing before the association of partners with Allah, due to His Greatness.

This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and it is supported by the Hadith related to the story of the card. And Allah knows best. Ad-Dahhak said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ</div><p>(Whereby the heavens are almost torn,) \"This means to be split apart into pieces due to the fear of the magnificence of Allah.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ</div><p>(and the earth is split asunder,) \"This is due to its anger on behalf of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً</div><p>(and the mountains Hadda.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means to be torn down.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Haddan means some of it is broken by other parts of it in succession.\" Imam Ahmad reported from Abu Musa that he said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ إِنَّهُ يُشْرَكُ بِهِ وَيُجْعَلُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ، وَهُوَ يُعَافِيهِمْ وَيَدْفَعُ عَنْهُمْ وَيَرْزُقُهُم»</div><p>(There is no one more patient than Allah concerning something harmful that he hears. For verily, partners are associated with Him and a son is ascribed to Him, while He is the One Who gives them good health, protects them and sustains them.) This narration is also recorded in the Two Sahihs. In one wording of it he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</div><p>(...that they attribute a son to Him, while He is the One Who sustains them and gives them good health.) Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً </div><p>(But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son.) Meaning that it is not befitting of Him, nor is it appropriate for His lofty majesty and greatness. There is no coequal for Him in His creation, because all creatures are His slaves. This is why He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً </div><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a slave. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting.) He knows their number from the time He created them, until the Day of Resurrection, male and female, both the small and the large of them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً </div><p>(And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) This means that there will be no helper for him and no one to save him, except Allah alone, Who has no partners. He judges His creatures as He wills and He is the Most Just, Who does not do even an atom's weight of injustice. He will not wrong anyone.</p>"
