The Quran banished these superstitions, and re-established the relations between men and women on a natural basis. Despite this, there are people who do not adopt the way of reform, and who can, therefore, expect nothing but loss on God’s earth.</p>"

This vast system of the universe has been brought into being in order to make man recognise the Creator through it and have a deep and inner realisation of God’s immense Power.</p>"
