Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,) meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى</div><p>(and for a specified term.) meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease. Allah continues,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ</div><p>(But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.) Meaning, the disbelievers are distracted from what is intended for them. Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that.

They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.)

(Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken only idols besides Allah!

This is what they said. That which has been confirmed in the Sahih is that the believers said, \"May you enjoy that, O Allah's Messenger! But what do we get\" So Allah revealed this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit, reported that Umm Al-`Ala' -- a woman from the Ansar who had given her pledge of loyalty to Allah's Messenger -- said, \"When the Ansar drew lots regarding taking in the Muhajirun to dwell with them, our lot was to have `Uthman bin Maz`un. Later, `Uthman fell sick in our house, so we nursed him until he died, and we wrapped him in his garments (for burial). Allah's Messenger then came in, and I said, `O Abu As-Sa'ib!

But by Allah, even though I am Allah's Messenger, I do not know what will happen to me (after death).) I then said, `Never will I claim a person to be pious after this.' This incident caused me some distress, and I went to sleep thereafter. I saw in my dream that `Uthman owned a running water spring. I went to Allah's Messenger and told him about that. Allah's Messenger said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكِ عَمَلُه»</div><p>(That was his (good) deeds.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith but Muslim did not.

This and similar texts indicate that it is not allowed to declare that a specific person will enter Jannah except for those who were distinctly indicated by Allah or his Messenger . Examples of those are the Ten, Ibn Sallam, Al-Ghumaysa', Bilal, Suraqah, `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Haram (Jabir's father), the Seventy Recitors (of Qur'an) who were assassinated near the Well of Ma`unah, Zayd bin Harithah, Ja`far, Ibn Rawahah, and other similar individuals, may Allah be pleased with them.

      "text": "<h2>Refuting Claims of the Idolators about the Qur'an and the Messenger</h2><p>Concerning the disbelief and rebellion of the idolators, Allah says that when the clear Ayat of Allah are recited to them they say;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(This is plain magic!) meaning, simple magic. In this statement of theirs, they have lied, invented a falsehood, went astray and disbelieved.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ</div><p>(Or they say: \"He has fabricated it.\" ) They are referring to Muhammad . Allah responds saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً</div><p>(Say: \"If I have fabricated it, you have no power to support me against Allah...\") which means, `if I lie against Allah and falsely claim that He sent me when He actually had not, then He would punish me with a severe punishment. No one on the earth -- you or anyone else -- would then be able to protect me from Him.' It is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنِّى لَن يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ اللَّهِ أَحَدٌ وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِسَـلَـتِهِ</div><p>(Say: \"None can protect me from Allah, nor would I find a refuge except in Him. (My duty) is only to convey from Allah and (deliver) His Messages. \") (72:22-23) Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ الاٌّقَاوِيلِ - لأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُ بِالْيَمِينِ - ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ الْوَتِينَ - فَمَا مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَـجِزِينَ </div><p>(And if he made up a false saying concerning Us, We surely would have seized him by the right hand. Then we would have cut off his life artery. And none of you could withhold Us from (punishing) him.) (69:44-47) Thus, Allah says here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنِ افْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِى مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ كَفَى بِهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ</div><p>(Say: \"If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allah. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur'an)! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you!...\") This is a severe threat, intimidation and warning for them. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.) This is an encouragement for them to repent and turn to Allah. It means, `despite all of this, if you turn back and repent, Allah will accept your repentance, pardon you, forgive you, and have mercy upon on.' This is similar to Allah's saying in Surat Al-Furqan,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً - قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً </div><p>(And they say: \"(This Book is) legends of the ancients that he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\" Say: \"It has been sent down by the One Who knows every secret within the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\") (25:5-6) Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ</div><p>(Say: \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers...\") which means, `I am not the first Messenger who ever came to the world. Rather, Messengers came before me. Therefore, I am not an unprecedented incident that should cause you all to reject me and doubt my being sent to you. Indeed, Allah has sent before me all of the Prophets to various nations.' Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَدْرِى مَا يُفْعَلُ بِى وَلاَ بِكُمْ</div><p>(nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"It (this Ayah) was followed in revelation by,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</div><p>(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). Similarly, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said that this Ayah was abrogated by the Ayah;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ</div><p>(That Allah may forgive for you your sins of the past and future). They said that when the latter Ayah was revealed, one of the Muslims said to Allah's Messenger , \"Allah has declared what He will do for you. But what will He do for us\" Then Allah revealed;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيُدْخِلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</div><p>(That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow). This is what they said. That which has been confirmed in the Sahih is that the believers said, \"May you enjoy that, O Allah's Messenger! But what do we get\" So Allah revealed this Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit, reported that Umm Al-`Ala' -- a woman from the Ansar who had given her pledge of loyalty to Allah's Messenger -- said, \"When the Ansar drew lots regarding taking in the Muhajirun to dwell with them, our lot was to have `Uthman bin Maz`un. Later, `Uthman fell sick in our house, so we nursed him until he died, and we wrapped him in his garments (for burial). Allah's Messenger then came in, and I said, `O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Allah have mercy on you. I bear witness that Allah has indeed honored you.' Allah's Messenger asked,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَا يُدْرِيكِ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى أَكْرَمَه»</div><p>(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, `I do not know -- may my father and mother both be ransoms for you!' Allah's Messenger then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ مِنْ رَبِّهِ،وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْرَ. وَاللهِ مَا أَدْرِي وَأَنَا رَسُولُ اللهِ مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي»</div><p>(As for him, certainty (death) has reached him from his Lord, and I surely wish well for him.

      "text": "<h2>Mention of the Undutiful Children and Their End</h2><p>In the previous Ayat, Allah mentions the dutiful offspring who supplicate for their parents and treat them with kindness. He describes the success and salvation He has prepared for them. Here He connects to that discussion the situation of the wretched offspring who are undutiful toward their parents. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! ...\") As for the saying \"Uff\" in this Ayah, it is a general description applying to anyone who says it to his parents. Some people claim that it was revealed about `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr. But this claim is weak and rejected, because `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr embraced Islam after this was revealed. His adherence to Islam was excellent, and he was among the best of his contemporaries. Al-Bukhari recorded from Yusuf bin Mahak that Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) was governor of Hijaz (Western Arabia), appointed by Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. He (Marwan) delivered a speech in which he mentioned Yazid bin Mu`awiyah and urged the people to give a pledge of allegiance after his father. `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said something to him in response to that, upon which Marwan commanded his men: \"Arrest him!\" But he entered `Aishah's house, and they were not able to capture him. Marwan then said: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! Do you promise me that I will be raised -- when generations before me have passed\")\" From behind the curtain, `Aishah responded: \"Allah did not reveal any Qur'an in our regard (i.e. the children of Abu Bakr), except for the declaration of my innocence.\" In another report recorded by An-Nasa'i, Muhammad bin Ziyad reported that when Mu`awiyah was soliciting people to pledge allegiance to his son, and Marwan declared: \"This follows the tradition of Abu Bakr and `Umar.\" On hearing this, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said: \"Rather, this is the tradition of Heraclius and Caesar.\" Marwan responded: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you!\")\" When that was conveyed to `A'ishah, she said: \"Marwan is lying! By Allah, that was not revealed about him. If I wish to name the person meant by it, I could. On the other hand, Allah's Messenger placed a curse on Marwan's father (Al- Hakam bin Abi Al-`As when Marwan was still in his loins, so Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) is an outcome of Allah's curse.\" As for Allah's statement:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ</div><p>(Do you promise me that I will be raised) meaning, resurrected.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى</div><p>(when generations before me have passed) meaning, generations of people have already passed away, and none of them has ever returned to tell (what happened to them)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ اللَّهَ</div><p>(While they invoke Allah for help) meaning, they ask Allah to guide him, and they say to their son,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلَكَ ءَامِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَيَقُولُ مَا هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(\"Woe to you! Believe! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.\" But he says: \"This is nothing but the legends of the ancient.\") Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ فِى أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَـسِرِينَ </div><p>(They are those against whom the Word (of torment) has justified among the previous generations of Jinn and mankind that have passed away.Verily, they are ever the losers.) This indicates that all such people will be among their likes and their peers among the disbelievers, who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ</div><p>(Those are) after He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ</div><p>(But he who says ) confirms what we have mentioned above that the latter is a general description of a type of people including all those who fall under that description. Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said, \"This applies to the disbelieving, sinful person who is undutiful to his parents and who denies resurrection.\" Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَـتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُواْ</div><p>(And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did,) meaning that there will be degrees of punishment for each of them according to what they did.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</div><p>(so that He might fully recompense them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.) which means Allah will not be unjust to them even in the amount of a speck of dust or less. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said: \"The levels of the Fire descend, and those of Paradise ascend.\" Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا</div><p>(On the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): \"You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein...\") which means that this will be said to them by way of blame and reprimand. The Commander of the faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, gave up many of the joys of food and drink and refrained from them while saying, \"I am afraid of being like those whom Allah has reproached and condemned by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا</div><p>(You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein).\" Abu Mijlaz said: \"Some people will lose good deeds that they had in the worldly life, and they will be told,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(You received your good things in the life of the world).\" Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ</div><p>(Today, you will be recompensed with the torment of extreme humiliation, because you were arrogant upon the earth without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allah's command.) which indicates that their punishment will be of a type comparable to their deeds. They enjoyed themselves, were arrogant in their denial of the truth, and were involved in sinning and disobedience. Thus, Allah punishes them with extreme humiliation, disgrace, severe pains, continued sorrow, and positions in the terrible depths of Hell -- may Allah protect us from all of that.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>Mention of the Undutiful Children and Their End</h2><p>In the previous Ayat, Allah mentions the dutiful offspring who supplicate for their parents and treat them with kindness. He describes the success and salvation He has prepared for them. Here He connects to that discussion the situation of the wretched offspring who are undutiful toward their parents. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! ...\") As for the saying \"Uff\" in this Ayah, it is a general description applying to anyone who says it to his parents. Some people claim that it was revealed about `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr. But this claim is weak and rejected, because `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr embraced Islam after this was revealed. His adherence to Islam was excellent, and he was among the best of his contemporaries. Al-Bukhari recorded from Yusuf bin Mahak that Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) was governor of Hijaz (Western Arabia), appointed by Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. He (Marwan) delivered a speech in which he mentioned Yazid bin Mu`awiyah and urged the people to give a pledge of allegiance after his father. `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said something to him in response to that, upon which Marwan commanded his men: \"Arrest him!\" But he entered `Aishah's house, and they were not able to capture him. Marwan then said: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you! Do you promise me that I will be raised -- when generations before me have passed\")\" From behind the curtain, `Aishah responded: \"Allah did not reveal any Qur'an in our regard (i.e. the children of Abu Bakr), except for the declaration of my innocence.\" In another report recorded by An-Nasa'i, Muhammad bin Ziyad reported that when Mu`awiyah was soliciting people to pledge allegiance to his son, and Marwan declared: \"This follows the tradition of Abu Bakr and `Umar.\" On hearing this, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr said: \"Rather, this is the tradition of Heraclius and Caesar.\" Marwan responded: \"This is the one about whom Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى قَالَ لِوَلِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ</div><p>(But he who says to his parents: \"Uff to you!\")\" When that was conveyed to `A'ishah, she said: \"Marwan is lying!

On the other hand, Allah's Messenger placed a curse on Marwan's father (Al- Hakam bin Abi Al-`As when Marwan was still in his loins, so Marwan (bin Al-Hakam) is an outcome of Allah's curse.\" As for Allah's statement:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَعِدَانِنِى أَنْ أُخْرَجَ</div><p>(Do you promise me that I will be raised) meaning, resurrected.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَلَتِ الْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِى</div><p>(when generations before me have passed) meaning, generations of people have already passed away, and none of them has ever returned to tell (what happened to them)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ اللَّهَ</div><p>(While they invoke Allah for help) meaning, they ask Allah to guide him, and they say to their son,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلَكَ ءَامِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَيَقُولُ مَا هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(\"Woe to you! Believe! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.\" But he says: \"This is nothing but the legends of the ancient.\") Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ فِى أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَـسِرِينَ </div><p>(They are those against whom the Word (of torment) has justified among the previous generations of Jinn and mankind that have passed away.Verily, they are ever the losers.) This indicates that all such people will be among their likes and their peers among the disbelievers, who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.

The Commander of the faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, gave up many of the joys of food and drink and refrained from them while saying, \"I am afraid of being like those whom Allah has reproached and condemned by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا</div><p>(You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein).\" Abu Mijlaz said: \"Some people will lose good deeds that they had in the worldly life, and they will be told,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـتِكُمْ فِى حَيَـتِكُمُ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(You received your good things in the life of the world).\" Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ</div><p>(Today, you will be recompensed with the torment of extreme humiliation, because you were arrogant upon the earth without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allah's command.) which indicates that their punishment will be of a type comparable to their deeds. They enjoyed themselves, were arrogant in their denial of the truth, and were involved in sinning and disobedience. Thus, Allah punishes them with extreme humiliation, disgrace, severe pains, continued sorrow, and positions in the terrible depths of Hell -- may Allah protect us from all of that.</p>"

(72:19)\" Sufyan said, \"They stood on top of each other like piled wool.\" Ahmad was alone in recording this. Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah's Messenger never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, `We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the Fajr prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said: `By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Then they returned to their people and told them: `Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' So Allah revealed to His Prophet ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ</div><p>(Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an).) (72:19) Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.\" Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah. When they heard him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ</div><p>(They said: \"Listen quietly.\") meaning, hush! They were nine in number, and one of them was called Zawba`ah. So Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ </div><p>(And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: \"Listen quietly!\" And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ</div><p>(they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger . This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ</div><p>(...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى</div><p>(And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ</div><p>(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ </div><p>(From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said \"both of them\" this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى</div><p>(They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...\") They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, \"Sent down after Musa.\" This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: \"Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</div><p>(confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ</div><p>(it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</div><p>(And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ</div><p>(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ</div><p>(it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ</div><p>(Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ</div><p>(He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that \"some\" here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ</div><p>(And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ</div><p>(and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best.</p>"

So Allah revealed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُواْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ </div><p>(And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: \"Listen quietly!\" And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّوْاْ إِلَى قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ</div><p>(they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger . This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِى الدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ</div><p>(...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى</div><p>(And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ</div><p>(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ</div><p>(O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ </div><p>(From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said \"both of them\" this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى</div><p>(They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...\") They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, \"Sent down after Musa.\" This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: \"Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</div><p>(confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ</div><p>(it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</div><p>(And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ</div><p>(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَهْدِى إِلَى الْحَقِّ</div><p>(it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ وَءَامِنُواْ بِهِ</div><p>(Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ</div><p>(He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that \"some\" here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِىَ اللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِى الاٌّرْضَ</div><p>(And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ</div><p>(and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best.</p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Story of the Jinns listening to the Qur'an</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded from Az-Zubayr that he commented on the Ayah;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ</div><p>(And (remember) when We sent towards you a group of the Jinn, to listen to the Qur'an.) \"They were at a place called Nakhlah while Allah's Messenger was performing the `Isha' prayer, and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً</div><p>(they crowded on top of each other to hear him.) (72:19)\" Sufyan said, \"They stood on top of each other like piled wool.\" Ahmad was alone in recording this. Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah's Messenger never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, `We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the Fajr prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said: `By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Then they returned to their people and told them: `Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' So Allah revealed to His Prophet ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ</div><p>(Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an).) (72:19) Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.\" Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah.

He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْبِرْ كَمَا صَبَرَ أُوْلُواْ الْعَزْمِ مِنَ الرُّسُلِ</div><p>(Therefore be patient as did those of determination among the Messengers.) meaning, as they were patient with their people's rejection of them. \"Those of determination\" among the Messengers are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, `Isa and the last of all of the Prophets, Muhammad . Allah has specifically mentioned their names in two Ayat: Surat Al-Ahzab (33:7) and Surat Ash-Shura (42:13).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِل لَّهُمْ</div><p>(and be in no hurry for them.) which means, `do not rush the punishment for them.' This is similar to Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَذَرْنِى وَالْمُكَذِّبِينَ أُوْلِى النَّعْمَةِ وَمَهِّلْهُمْ قَلِيلاً </div><p>(And leave Me alone to deal with the rejectors, those who are in possession of good things of life. And give them respite for a little while.) (73:11)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَهِّلِ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْهِلْهُمْ رُوَيْداً </div><p>(So allow time for the disbelievers, and leave them for a while.) (86:17) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّن نَّهَارٍ</div><p>(On the Day when they will see that which they are promised, it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except an hour in a day.) Which is similar to Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا </div><p>(On the Day they see it (the Hour), it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except for a day's afternoon or its morning.) (79:46) and as He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ</div><p>(And on the Day when He shall gather them together, (it will be) as if they had not stayed but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other.)(10:45) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلاَغٌ</div><p>(A clear message.) meaning, this Qur'an provides a clear concept.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ</div><p>(But will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people) Which means that Allah does not destroy anyone except those who choose the way of destruction. It is part of Allah's justice that He does not punish anyone except those who deserve the punishment -- and Allah knows best. This concludes the explanation of Surat Al-Ahqaf. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Both success and protection from faults are by His help.</p>"
