Then when he completed the prayer, he informed them that the Messenger of Allah prostrated during its recitation. This was recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i on the authority of Malik. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Rafi` that he prayed the Night prayer with Abu Hurayrah) recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ </div><p>(When the heaven is split asunder.) then he prostrated. So Abu Rafi` said something to him about it (questioning it).

This will occur on the Day of Judgement.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحُقَّتْ</div><p>(and it must do so.) meaning, it is right for it to obey the command of its Lord, because it is great and cannot be rejected, nor overcome. Rather it overpowers everything and everything is submissive to it. Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا الاٌّرْضُ مُدَّتْ </div><p>(And when the earth is stretched forth,) meaning, when the earth is expanded, spread out and extended. Then He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ </div><p>(And has cast out all that was in it and became empty.) meaning, it throws out the dead inside of it, and it empties itself of them. This was said by Mujahid, Sa`id, and Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ </div><p>(And listens to and obeys its Lord, and it must do so.)

A proof for this is what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Jabir, that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ، وَأَحْبِبْ (مَنْ) شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُلَاقِيه»</div><p>(Jibril said, \"O Muhammad!

There are some people who refer the pronoun back to the statement \"your Lord.\" Thus, they hold the Ayah to mean, \"and you will meet your Lord.\" This means that He will reward you for your work, and pay you for your efforts. Therefore, both of these two views are connected. Al-`Awfi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said explaining,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً</div><p>(O man!

This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ عُذِّب»</div><p>(Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah  then said, \"But didn't Allah say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً </div><p>(He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)\" The Prophet replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ ذَاكِ بِالْحِسَابِ، وَلَــكِنْ ذلِكِ الْعَرْضُ، مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ  يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عُذِّب»</div><p>(That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation.

In reference to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً </div><p>(And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. They also said, \"Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has given him.\" Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ </div><p>(But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُوراً </div><p>(He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَصْلَى سَعِيراً - إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً </div><p>(And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning.

His light happiness will be followed by long grief.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ </div><p>(Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً </div><p>(Yes!

He was ever watchful of him, meaning All-Knowing and All-Aware.</p>"
