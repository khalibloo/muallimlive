This is what Ibn Jarir preferred, may Allah have mercy upon him. Mujahid said, \"An-Najm (the star); the one that is in the sky.\" Al-Hasan and Qatadah said similarly.

Allah raised the heavens and put down, or laid, the earth and balanced it with firm mountains, so that it would be stable for its residents that live on it, i.e. the various types and kinds of creatures, different in species, shape, color and language. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Al-An'am means the creatures.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ</div><p>(Therein are fruits,) of various colors, taste and scent,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّخْلُ ذَاتُ الاٌّكْمَامِ</div><p>(and date palms producing Akmam.) Allah mentioned the date tree here specifically because of its benefit, both fresh and dry. Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said said Al-Akmam, means sheathed fruit stalks. Similar was said by more than one of the scholars of Tafsir, it refers to the stalks that the seeds grow in to become a cluster of dates, unripe green dates then they ripen and ripen more. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ </div><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that in,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ</div><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf), `Asf means straw.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"`Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called `Asf when it dries out.\" Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that `Asf means straw. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves. The meanings here, and Allah knows best, are the various crops that produce straw, such as wheat and barley, and Rayhan are the leaves that grow on the stems.</p><h2>Mankind is surrounded by Allah's Favors</h2>Allah said,<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ </div><p>(13.

This is the saying that is the most obvious, and Allah knows best, for Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ وَالنُّجُومُ وَالْجِبَالُ وَالشَّجَرُ وَالدَّوَآبُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(See you not that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the moving creatures, and many of mankind prostrate themselves to Allah.)(22:18) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّمَآءَ رَفَعَهَا وَوَضَعَ الْمِيزَانَ </div><p>(And the heaven He has raised high, and He has set up the balance.) meaning the justice, as He said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مَعَهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْمِيزَانَ لِيَقُومَ النَّاسُ بِالْقِسْطِ</div><p>(Indeed, We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and sent down with them the Book and the balance that mankind may keep up equity.)(57:25) Allah said here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَطْغَوْاْ فِى الْمِيزَانِ </div><p>(In order that you may not transgress the balance.) meaning, He created the heavens and earth in justice and truth so that everything is founded on, and observing, justice and truth. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقِيمُواْ الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلاَ تُخْسِرُواْ الْمِيزَانَ </div><p>(And observe the weight with equity and do not make the balance deficient.) meaning, do not cheat in the weights and measures, but rather observe justice and fairness,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزِنُواْ بِالْقِسْطَاسِ الْمُسْتَقِيمِ </div><p>(And weigh with the true and straight balance.)(26:182) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّرْضَ وَضَعَهَا لِلاٌّنَامِ </div><p>(And the earth He has put down (laid) for Al-Ana'm.) Allah raised the heavens and put down, or laid, the earth and balanced it with firm mountains, so that it would be stable for its residents that live on it, i.e. the various types and kinds of creatures, different in species, shape, color and language. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Al-An'am means the creatures.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ</div><p>(Therein are fruits,) of various colors, taste and scent,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّخْلُ ذَاتُ الاٌّكْمَامِ</div><p>(and date palms producing Akmam.) Allah mentioned the date tree here specifically because of its benefit, both fresh and dry. Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said said Al-Akmam, means sheathed fruit stalks. Similar was said by more than one of the scholars of Tafsir, it refers to the stalks that the seeds grow in to become a cluster of dates, unripe green dates then they ripen and ripen more. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ </div><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that in,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ</div><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf), `Asf means straw.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"`Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called `Asf when it dries out.\" Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that `Asf means straw. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves. The meanings here, and Allah knows best, are the various crops that produce straw, such as wheat and barley, and Rayhan are the leaves that grow on the stems.</p><h2>Mankind is surrounded by Allah's Favors</h2>Allah said,<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ </div><p>(13. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p><p> meaning, \"O mankind and Jinn,which of the favors that Allah has given to you do you deny\" Muj ahid and others said this, and itis apparent when one reads what comes af ter it . Meaning the favors that are obvious to youwhile you are surrounded by them, you cannot deny or rej ect them. So we say, just as thebelievers among the Jinns said, \"O Allah! None of Your favors do we deny. All praise is due toYou. \" Ibn ` Abbas used to say, \"Nay, our Lord! \" meaning, \"None of Your favors do we deny. \"</p>"

This means they will melt just as sediment and silver are melted when heated. And they will be colored, just as dies stain something, sometimes red, sometimes yellow, or blue, or green.

Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْـَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ - عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do.)(15:92-93) Qatadah said, \"On that they will be questioned and then their mouths will be sealed and their hands and feet will reveal what they used to do.\" Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُعْرَفُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ بِسِيمَـهُمْ</div><p>(The criminals will be known by their marks,) i.e., by special marks that distinguish them. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"They will be known by their dark faces and their blue eyes.\" I say that this contrasts to the marks that will distinguish the believers, such as the light that will appear on the parts of the body that they used to wash while performing ablution. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيُؤْخَذُ بِالنَّوَاصِى وَالاٌّقْدَامِ</div><p>(and they will be seized by their foreheads and feet.) meaning, the angels of punishment will bend their heads down to their feet and throw them like this into the Hellfire. Al-A`mash said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"He will be taken by his forehead and his feet and be broken just as a stick is broken to be thrown into an oven.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ الَّتِى يُكَذِّبُ بِهَا الْمُجْرِمُونَ </div><p>(This is the Hell which the criminals denied.) meaning, `this is the Fire that you used to deny existed that it; now you see it before your eyes!'

Qatadah also commented, \"Its boiling started when Allah created the heavens and the earth!\" Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said, \"The (disobedient) servant will be seized by the forehead and stirred in that boiling water until his flesh melts and only the bones and the eyes in his head remain.

So His saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَمِيمٍ ءَانٍ</div><p>(Hamim An.) Hamim, that is very hot. Surely, punishing the disobedient criminals as well as favoring those who had Taqwa, is from Allah's grace, mercy, justice, compassion and kindness for His creatures. His warnings against His torment and punishment, such as mentioned in these Ayat, should encourage all creatures to abandon the Shirk and disobedience they engage in, and this is why Allah reminded them of this favor;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ </div><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p>"

And a place in Paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you, is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. If one of the women of the people of Paradise looks directly at the earth, she will fill what is between Paradise and earth with a good scent and all of it will become delightful. Verily, the veil over her head is better than this life and all that is on its surface.) Al-Bukhari also collected a similar narration. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ </div><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) Allah declares that in the Hereafter, all that is good and righteous is the only befitting reward for those who do good deeds in this life,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</div><p>(For those who have done good is best (reward) and even more.)(10:26) All of these are tremendous blessings that cannot be earned merely by good deeds, but by Allah's favor and bounty, after all of these He says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ </div><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p>"

Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that `A'ishah said, \"When the Messenger of Allah would (say the) Salam (completing prayer), he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلَامُ، تَبَارَكْتَ يَاذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</div><p>(O Allah! You are As-Salam, and peace comes from You. Blessed be You Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram.).\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ar-Rahman, all praise is due to Allah and all favors come from Him.</p>"
