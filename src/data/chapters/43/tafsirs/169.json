Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection.

By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified.

      "text": "<h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.

He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p>"

This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</div><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</div><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p>"

He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms.

He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.)

      "text": "<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay!

Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.

He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah.

Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him!

(21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.

(21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.

Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them.

Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</div><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَطِيعُونِ</div><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>(Verily, Allah!

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p>"

Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197).

Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up.

He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.)

When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.)

Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</div><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</div><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَطِيعُونِ</div><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</div><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(My servants!

Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(My servants!

(وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</div><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ </div><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient.

This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.)

He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُ</div><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَدَيْنَآ</div><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence.

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)

(33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</div><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</div><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</div><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</div><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it.

There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82).

By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</div><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزُخْرُفاً</div><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</div><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُحْبَرُونَ</div><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</div><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</div><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ </div><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.'

(33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</div><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</div><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</div><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</div><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.)

When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</div><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</div><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

(21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay!

Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it.

Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it.

For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy.

And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.)

Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.)

Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

(26:195)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُ</div><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَدَيْنَآ</div><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence.

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)

(33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</div><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</div><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</div><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</div><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</div><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزُخْرُفاً</div><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82).

By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</div><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزُخْرُفاً</div><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder).

This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</div><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُحْبَرُونَ</div><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</div><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</div><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ </div><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.'

(33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</div><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</div><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</div><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</div><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.)

When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</div><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</div><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

(21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay!

Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it.

Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it.

For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy.

And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.)

Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.)

Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

(26:195)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُ</div><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَدَيْنَآ</div><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence.

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)

(33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</div><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</div><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</div><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</div><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</div><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزُخْرُفاً</div><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"

This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82).

By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</div><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</div><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</div><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</div><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</div><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ </div><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </div><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى </div><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ </div><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ </div><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ </div><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</div><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</div><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</div><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</div><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</div><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</div><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</div><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</div><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ </div><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</div><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</div><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</div><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</div><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</div><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</div><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ</div><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</div><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</div><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</div><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</div><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</div><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزُخْرُفاً</div><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</div><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</div><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</div><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</div><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</div><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْشُ</div><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</div><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)

Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</div><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder).

This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</div><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</div><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ </div><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</div><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</div><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى </div><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</div><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</div><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</div><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</div><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</div><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</div><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</div><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ </div><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</div><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</div><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</div><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</div><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</div><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</div><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</div><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</div><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</div><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبِعُونِ</div><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</div><p>(This is the straight path.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</div><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُحْبَرُونَ</div><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</div><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</div><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ </div><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</div><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</div><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا </div><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</div><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</div><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ </div><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</div><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</div><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</div><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </div><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ </div><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</div><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَلْعَبُواْ</div><p>(and play) in their world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</div><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</div><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</div><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</div><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّفَـعَةَ</div><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ </div><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</div><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً </div><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ </div><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>"
