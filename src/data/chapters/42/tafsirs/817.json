The Prophet Muhammad came into this world to make people aware of this reality. His mission fell into two parts—one direct and the other indirect. His direct mission affected Makkah and the areas surrounding it. He completed this part of the mission during his lifetime. His indirect mission through his followers is for the whole world. This mission of his, still continues and will continue till Doomsday. The Prophet Muhammad presented his message to the Arab people in the Arabic language. After him, his followers too, as his deputies, have to fulfill their dawah responsibilities by adhering to the same principles. They are required to convey the message of Truth to every nation in its own language. Only when a nation is presented the message in its own language, will they be treated as having discharged the responsibility of conveying the message.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">The prophets came into this world with the same religion and that is the religion of the oneness of God. But the followers of these prophets subsequently divided themselves into separate factions. The reason for this was the shift in the centre of their attention. Initially, attention was centred wholly on God: the teachings of all prophets took the form of exhorting people to worship the one and only God. That was their original religion but their followers later shifted the focus of their devotion and they became the worshippers of beings other than God. The ancient people of Arabia were initially the followers of Abraham. But, later on, the greatness of their leaders so captured their minds that they made them the sole centre of their attention. They even made idols to represent them and started worshipping them. The Jews were the followers of Moses, but they started considering their race a special one. Their attention became so concentrated on their own race, that godly religion became for them a racial matter. They rejected the last of the prophets simply because he was not born of their race. Similarly, Christians were the followers of Jesus Christ (‘Isa). But they took him to be the son of God instead of His Prophet. In this way, in the religion they later adopted, the notion of Jesus being the son of God attained the utmost importance. What God desires for His subjects is that they should be firm in the belief of the oneness of God. The one and only God should be the centre of all their attention. This constitutes real steadfastness in religion ‘din’. Any shift in this centre of attention amounts to polytheism (shirk). Whenever polytheism gains ground with the people, variations and differences immediately start making their appearance, because in the case of ‘shirk’, many centres of attention come into existence. In the case of ‘tawhid’ (unity of God), on the contrary, the centre of attention is only one—God: this creates a greater sense of unity among the faithful. Though the religion of the Prophet of Arabia is a preserved religion as far as its text is concerned, his followers are disparate in their beliefs and practices. People however, are free to make new things their centre of attention, to make changes in the original religion by having recourse to explanations and interpretations of the text, and in this way turn one religion, in practice, into several religions.</p>"

      "text": "<p lang=\"en\">To differ after being given knowledge means that, even after receiving the call for Truth, man ignores it or opposes it. Through the Prophet Muhammad, God Almighty revealed religion (din) in its pure form. This meant that all those who were desirous of God should have joined it. But, they were not prepared to join the Prophet. By remaining attached to the previous prophets, they enjoyed the position of the pious ones among the people. They thought that this was enough for them, while the fact is that when the call of the True Religion is raised it becomes compulsory on the part of all the people to demolish their biases and prejudices and join the True Religion. Those who do not do so are guilty in the eyes of God, irrespective of their being ostensibly religious. When the call of True religion is given, some people reject it out of jealousy or a false sense of pride (bagh’i), while others stay away from it because of their doubts. This is the case of such people as have attained an elevated status in society. Acceptance of Truth by them would involve stepping down from their high positions. As they are not prepared to lower themselves, they set about belittling the call for Truth in order to justify their stand. The common people are generally beset by doubt and hesitation. The call of the preacher of Truth appears to them weighty on the basis of argument, but at the same time they find it difficult to ignore the great ones whose imagined greatness is already impressed on their minds. This dual pressure becomes a hindrance to their reaching a final decision. The first group ignores the Truth under the influence of a false sense of pride, while the second group does not accept it under the influence of doubt. In effect, both groups thus deprive themselves of the Truth.</p>"

Therefore the revelation of God’s words to the prophets was made in an indirect manner. There are many methods of indirect revelation. Examples of these are found in the lives of the various prophets. When a scholar writes a book or a thinker delivers his discourse, he has a scholastic background which may account or offer an explanation for his later successful academic or intellectual achievement. But the case of the prophet is entirely different. A prophet’s life after attaining prophethood is entirely different from what it was before that event. The present work of a common man appears to be a continuation of or stems from his past life. But, in the case of a prophet, his utterances after the attainment of prophethood are so distinct from those of the earlier period, prior to prophethood, that they cannot be accounted for or explained on the basis of his past. This is a clear indication that a prophet’s words are, in reality, divine in origin and not an ordinary human discourse. What is special about the Prophet Muhammad is that the Quran (the divine message) conveyed by him and his own personal utterances have both been preserved and still exist in their original form. If one who knows Arabic makes a comparative study of both, he will find an obvious difference between these two. The language of the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet) is clearly that of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah, while the language of the Quran is clearly that of God.</p>"
