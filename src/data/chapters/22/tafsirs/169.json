Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey.

We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir.

Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed.

The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ </div><p>(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah.</p><h2>The Issue of renting Houses in Makkah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</div><p>(which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</div><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</div><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</div><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»</div><p>(Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»</div><p>(A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah , Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</div><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best.</p><h2>A Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you. If a person does this, then he deserves to suffer a painful torment.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(or to do wrong,) Mujahid said, \"To do some bad action therein. This is one of the unique features of Al-Haram, that the person who is about to do some evil action should be punished if this is his intention, even if he has not yet commenced the action.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded in his Tafsir that `Abdullah (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud) commented about the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"If a man intends to do some evil action therein, Allah will make him taste a painful torment.\" This was also recorded by Ahmad. I say, its chain is Sahih according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari, and it is more likely Mawquf than Marfu`. And Allah knows best. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays. The Messenger of Allah sent him with two men, one of whom was a Muhajir and the other from among the Ansar. They began to boast about their lineages and `Abdullah bin Unays got angry and killed the Ansari. Then he reverted from Islam (became an apostate) and fled to Makkah. Then these words were revealed concerning him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</div><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) meaning, whoever flees to Al-Haram to do evil actions, i.e., by leaving Islam.\" These reports indicate some meanings of the phrase \"evil actions\", but the meaning is more general than that and includes things which are more serious. Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ </div><p>(Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»</div><p>(This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.)</p>"

Mujahid said: \"Al-Budn means camels.\" According to Muslim, Jabir bin `Abdullah and others said, \"The Messenger of Allah commanded us to share in offering the sacrifice, a Budn (camel) for seven people, and one cow for seven people.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ</div><p>(wherein you have much good. ) means, reward in the Hereafter.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ</div><p>(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice).)

O Allah, this is on behalf of me and anyone of my Ummah who has not offered a sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Yazid bin Abi Habib from Ibn `Abbas that Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah sacrificed two rams on the day of `Id, and when he lay them down to sacrifice them, he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ مِنْكَ وَلَكَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأُمَّتِه»</div><p>(I turn my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, being true and sincere in faith submitting myself to Him Alone, and I am not of the idolators. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists for, with no partner or associate for Him. Thus am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O Allah, from You and to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his Ummah.) Then he said, `Bismillah' and `Allahu Akbar' and slaughtered them.\" It was reported from `Ali bin Al-Husayn from Abu Rafi` that when the Messenger of Allah wanted to offer a sacrifice, he would buy two fat, horned, fine rams. When he had prayed and addressed the people, he would bring one of them to where he was standing in the prayer place, and would sacrifice it himself with a knife, then he would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنْ أُمَّتِي جَمِيعِهَا: مَنْ شَهِدَ لَكَ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لِي بِالْبَلَاغ»</div><p>(O Allah, this is on behalf of all of my Ummah, whoever bears witness of Tawhid of You and bears witness that I have conveyed.) Then he would bring the other ram and sacrifice it himself, and say,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَذَا عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّد»</div><p>(This is on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.) He would give them to the poor and he and his family would eat from it as well. This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Zabiyan from Ibn `Abbas,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ</div><p>(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). ) \"When they are standing on three legs, with the left foreleg tied up. He says Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah, Allahumma Minka wa Laka (In the Name of Allah and Allah is Most Great; there is no God but Allah. O Allah, from You and to You).\" In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Umar came to a man who had made his camel kneel down in order to sacrifice it. He said, \"Make it stand up fettered, (this is) the Sunnah of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad ).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</div><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"This means, when it has fallen to the ground.\" This was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and a similar view was narrated from Muqatil bin Hayyan. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</div><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) \"Meaning, when they have died.\" This is what was meant by the comment of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid, for it is not permitted to eat from the sacrifice when it has been slaughtered until it has died and its movements have ceased. It was reported in a Marfu` Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُعَجِّلُوا النُّفُوسَ أَنْ تَزْهَق»</div><p>(Do not rush until you are sure that the animal is dead. ) Ath-Thawri narrated in his Jami` that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that, and he supported it with the Hadith of Shaddad bin `Aws in Sahih Muslim:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَه»</div><p>(Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. If you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.) It was recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا قُطِعَ مِنَ الْبَهِيمَةِ وَهِيَ حَيَّةٌ فَهُوَ مَيْتَة»</div><p>(Whatever is cut from an animal while it is still alive is Maytah (dead flesh).) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</div><p>(eat thereof, and feed Qani` and the Mu`tarr...) This is a command which implies that this is permissible. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is content with what he is given and he stays in his house, and the Mu`tarr is the one who comes to you and rubs shoulders with you so that you will give him some meat, but he does not ask for it. \" This was also the view of Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is too proud to ask, and Mu`tarr is the one who does ask.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mujahid, according to one report narrated from him. And the opposite was also suggested. This Ayah has been quoted as evidence by those scholars who said that the sacrifice should be divided into three: a third for the one who offers the sacrifice to eat from, a third to be given as gifts to his friends, and a third to be given in charity to the poor, because Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</div><p>(eat thereof, and feed the poor who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.) But there is no evidence in this Ayah for this view. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah said to the people: c</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنِ ادِّخَارِ لُحُومِ الْأَضَاحِي فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا مَا بَدَا لَكُم»</div><p>(I used to forbid you to keep the meat of the sacrifice for more than three days, but now eat from it and keep it as you see fit.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</div><p>(Eat some, keep some and give some in charity.) According to another report:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَكُلُوا وَأَطْعِمُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</div><p>(Eat some, feed others, and give some in charity.) As for the animal skins, it was recorded in Musnad Ahmad from Qatadah bin An-Nu`man in the Hadith about the sacrifice:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَكُلُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا، وَاسْتَمْتِعُوا بِجُلُودِهَا وَلَا تَبِيعُوهَا»</div><p>(Eat and give in charity, and make use of the skins, but do not sell them.) (Note) It was recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا نَبْدَأُ بِهِ فِي يَوْمِنَا هَذَا أَنْ نُصَلِّيَ، ثُمَّ نَرْجِعَ فَنَنْحَرَ، فَمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ أَصَابَ سُنَّتَنَا، وَمَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ لَحْمٌ قَدَّمَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ لَيْسَ مِنَ النُّسُكِ فِي شَيْء»</div><p>(The first thing that we should do on this day of ours (`Id) is to pray, then we return and offer the sacrifice. Whoever does that will have followed our Sunnah. Whoever slaughters his animal before the prayer, this is just meat which he has brought for his family, it is not a sacrifice at all.) This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And in Sahih Muslim, it is mentioned that one is not to offer the sacrifice until the Imam (leader) has offered his. It is prescribed to offer the sacrifice on the day of Nahr and the following three days of Tashriq, because of the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im who said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»</div><p>(The days of Tashriq are all (for) sacrifice.)

Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا</div><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, \"The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, \"We have more right to do that.\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ</div><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)

Ibn `Umar said, \"The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: \"At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting by sacrificing more than one and things reached the stage that you see now.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَذْبَحُوا إِلَّا مُسِنَّةً، إِلَّا أَنْ تَعْسُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَذْبَحُوا جَذَعَةً مِنَ الضَّأْن»</div><p>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</p>"

Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators.

      "text": "<h2>The Command to worship Allah and engage in Jihad</h2><p>It was reported from `Uqbah bin `Amir that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ بِسَجْدَتَيْنِ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْجُدْهُمَا فَلَا يَقْرَأْهُمَا»</div><p>(Surat Al-Hajj has been blessed with two Sajdahs, so whoever does not prostrate them should not read them.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَـهِدُوا فِى اللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَـدِهِ</div><p>(And strive hard in Allah's cause as you ought to strive.) means, with your wealth and your tongues and your bodies. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ</div><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah as is His due.) 3:102</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ</div><p>(He has chosen you,) means, `O Ummah of Islam, Allah has selected you and chosen you over all other nations, and has favored you and blessed you and honored you with the noblest of Messengers and the noblest of Laws.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</div><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) He has not given you more than you can bear and He has not obliged you to do anything that will cause you difficulty except that He has created for you a way out. So the Salah, which is the most important pillar of Islam after the two testimonies of faith, is obligatory, four Rak`ahs when one is settled, which are shortened to two Rak`ah when one is traveling. According to some Imams, only one Rak`ahs is obligatory at times of fear, as was recorded in the Hadith. A person may pray while walking or riding, facing the Qiblah or otherwise. When praying optional prayers while traveling, one may face the Qiblah or not. A person is not obliged to stand during the prayer if he is sick; the sick person may pray sitting down, and if he is not able to do that then he may pray lying on his side. And there are other exemptions and dispensations which may apply to the obligatory prayers and other duties. So the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»</div><p>(I have been sent with the easy Hanifi way.) And he said to Mu`adh and Abu Musa, when he sent them as governors to Yemen:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرا وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا»</div><p>(Give good news and do not repel them. Make things easy for the people and do not make the things difficult for them.) And there are many similar Hadiths. Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</div><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship), \"This means difficulty.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ</div><p>(It is the religion of your father Ibrahim. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This refers back to the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</div><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) meaning, any difficulty.\" On the contrary, He has made it easy for you, like the religion of your father Ibrahim. He said, \"It may be that it means: adhere to the religion of your father Ibrahim.\" I say: This interpretation of the Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</div><p>(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif) 6:161</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا</div><p>(He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an),) Imam `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj, from `Ata', from Ibn `Abbas: concerning Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(He has named you Muslims before) \"This refers to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Qatadah. Mujahid said, \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous Books and in Adh-Dhikr,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى هَـذَا</div><p>(and in this) means, the Qur'an.\" This was also the view of others, because Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</div><p>(He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) Then He urged them to follow the Message which His Messenger brought, by reminding them that this was the religion of their father Ibrahim. Then He mentioned His blessings to this Ummah, whereby He mentioned them and praised them long ago in the Books of the Prophets which were recited to the rabbis and monks. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(He has named you Muslims both before) meaning, before the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى هَـذَا</div><p>(and in this.) Under the explanation of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded from Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari from the Messenger of Allah , who said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ جِثِيِّ جَهَنَّم»</div><p>(Whoever adopts the call of Jahiliyyah, will be one of those who will crawl on their knees in Hell.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, even if he fasts and performs Salah\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى ، فَادْعُوا بِدَعْوَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي سَمَّاكُمْ بِهَا الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»</div><p>(Yes, even if he fasts and performs Salah. So adopt the call of Allah whereby He called you Muslims and believers and servants of Allah.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) means, `thus We have made you a just and fair nation, the best of nations, and all other nations will testify to your justice. On the Day of Resurrection you will be,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(witnesses over mankind),' because on that Day all the nations will acknowledge its leadership and its precedence over all others. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection the testimony of the members of this community will be accepted as proof that the Messengers conveyed the Message of their Lord to them, and the Messenger will testify that he conveyed the Message to them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ</div><p>(So perform the Salah, give Zakah) means, respond to this great blessing with gratitude by fulfilling your duties towards Allah, doing that which He has enjoined upon you and avoiding that which He had forbidden. Among the most important duties are establishing regular prayer and giving Zakah. Zakah is a form of beneficence towards Allah's creatures, whereby He has enjoined upon the rich to give a little of their wealth to the poor each year, to help the weak and needy. We have already mentioned its explanation in the Ayah of Zakah in Surat At-Tawbah (9:5).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(and hold fast to Allah.) means, seek the help and support of Allah and put your trust in Him, and get strength from Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ مَوْلَـكُمْ</div><p>(He is your Mawla,) meaning, He is your Protector and your Helper, He is the One Who will cause you to prevail against your enemies.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ</div><p>(what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper!) He is the best Mawla and the best Helper against your enemies. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hajj. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions, and grant them peace; may Allah honor and be pleased with the Companions and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Resurrection.</p>"
