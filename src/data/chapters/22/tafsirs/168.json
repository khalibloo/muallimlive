However, a majority of commentators believe that the Surah is a combination of both the Makkan and Madani verses, and Qurtubi prefers this view. He has also mentioned the other peculiarities of this Surah, namely that some of its verses were revealed at night and some during the day; some were revealed during travels and some when the Holy Prophet ﷺ was not traveling; some were revealed in Makkah and others at Madinah; some were revealed in the middle of battle and others in peace time. Some verses of this Surah are nasikh (verses of the Qur'an abrogating some other verses), and some are mansookh (verses of the Qur'an which have been abrogated by others); some are muhkam while others are mutashabih (مُتَشَابِہ). Indeed this Surah comprises all categories of revelations.</p><p>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَ‌بَّكُمْ (0 men, fear your Lord. - 22:1).This verse was revealed to the Holy Prophet ﷺ while he was traveling. He recited in a loud voice, so that all his companions gathered around him after hearing his voice. Then he addressed them \"Do you know when the upheaval of the Resurrection, which is mentioned in this verse, will take place?\" They replied, \"Allah and His Prophet ﷺ knows best.\" Then the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"That will be the day when Allah will command Sayyidna 'Adam (علیہ السلام) to raise those people who have been marked out for hell. Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) will ask Allah Ta'ala who those people are, and Allah will inform him that nine hundred and ninety nine out of every one thousand will go to hell.\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ then added, \"That will be the time when small children will become old on account of terror, and pregnant women will abort their fetuses.\" The companions were frightened when they heard this and asked the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، \"0 prophet of Allah! Who are those among us who will escape this terrible fate?\" The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied, \"Set your minds at ease. For every one thousand of the Gog and Magog (Ya’ juj and Ma'juj) there will be only one from amongst you.\" This incident is reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Abu Said Al-Khudri ؓ . There are other versions also according to which the Holy Prophet ﷺ is reported to have said, \"On the Day of Resurrection you will find yourself with two peoples who will predominate numerically all the other peoples who would be near them. One of them is the tribe of Gog and Magog (یا جوج ماجوج) and the other is the Shaitan and his descendants, and those of the progeny of Sayyidna 'Adam (علیہ السلام) who have died earlier.\" Thus, among the nine hundred and ninety nine the majority will be from those peoples. Qurtubi and others have quoted these narrations.</p><p>When will the earthquake of the Day of Resurrection take place?</p><p>Will it happen before or after the dead are raised to life? Some people have opined that the earthquake will occur in this world before the Day of Judgment and will be among the last signs of the coming of the Dooms Day, to which reference has been made in several verses of the Qur'an, such as:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْ‌ضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>When earth is shaken with a mighty shaking - 99:1</p><p>وَحُمِلَتِ الْأَرْ‌ضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>And the earth and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single blow - 69:14</p><p>إِذَا رُ‌جَّتِ الْأَرْ‌ضُ رَ‌جًّا</p><p>When the earth shall be rocked. 56:4</p><p>There are others who have deduced from the above-referred hadith that the earthquake will occur after the Dooms Day and Resurrection. In fact there is no inconsistency between these two views, because verses of the Qur'an and the ahadith of the Holy Prophet ﷺ may be quoted in support of either view. Allah knows best.</p><p>This verse also gives a picture of the earthquake of the Day of Resurrection when all the pregnant women will abort their fetuses and every breast-feeding woman nursing her child will be diverted from it. If the earthquake takes place in this world before the Dooms Day, then there is no ambiguity in all these happenings. But if the earthquake occurs after the Dooms Day, then the explanation would be that a pregnant woman would be raised on the Dooms Day in the same state, and a woman who died while breast-feeding her child will also be raised in the same condition along with her child.

This verse deals with the different stages through which the foetus passes in its mother's womb before taking a human form. There is a detailed hadith on this subject, which is reproduced in Sahih of Bukhari on the authority of Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ to the effect that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Human matter retains its original form in the woman's womb for forty days after which it becomes a clot of blood. After a further period of forty days it becomes a lump of flesh. Thereafter an angel is sent by Allah Ta’ ala who breaths a soul into it and records four things about it, namely how long it will live, how much sustenance it will receive, what acts he will do, and finally whether its end will be wretched or fortunate. (Qurtubi)</p><p>There is another narration which has been related by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir, also on the authority of ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ ، that when the seed becomes a lump of flesh after passing through different stages, the angel responsible to watch the progressive development of each individual then seeks guidance from Allah Ta’ ala saying: یَارَبّ مُخَلَّقَۃ او غیر مُخَلَّقۃ . That is, whether it is His will that the lump of flesh should be allowed to grow and become a living human being. If Allah says it is: غَیر مُخَلَّقۃ then the womb aborts the foetus and it does not reach the higher stages leading to a live birth. On the other hand, if Allah says that it is: مُخَلَّقۃ then the angel asks Him whether it is to be a boy or a girl, wretched or fortunate, how long it will live, how it will spend its life and when it will die. The angel is given information on all these matters then and there. (Ibn Kathir) Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas\tرضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما has also interpreted the words (مُخَلَّقَۃ او غیر مُخَلَّقۃ) in a similar manner. (Qurtubi)</p><p>مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ‌ مُخَلَّقَةٍ (shaped or unshaped - 22:5). It is evident from the hadith referred to above that the human seed which completes its full term in the womb and is destined to be born as a normal human being is meant by\t(shaped), whereas a seed which is destined to be aborted is (unshaped). However, there are other commentators who have explained these two words differently. According to them a foetus which completes all the stages of growth and development and whose limbs and other organs of the body are healthy, normal and proportionate ism (shaped). On the other hand, a foetus whose limbs are deformed or disproportionate is غَيْرِ‌ مُخَلَّقَةٍ (unshaped). The latter interpretation is close to the translation adopted above. Allah knows best.</p><p>ثُمَّ نُخْرِ‌جُكُمْ طِفْلًا Then We bring you out as babies - 22:5) Then Allah brings forth the baby from its mother's womb as a totally helpless thing. Its body is weak and so are its other faculties, such as hearing, vision, senses, brain function, and overall physical movements including its grasp. All theses faculties grow strong as time passes until they reach their full capability. This is the meaning of the words ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوا أَشُدَّكُمْ. (Then [ We nourish you ] so that you reach your maturity - 22:5). The word Ashudd اَشُد is the plural of shiddah شِدَّہ ، just as An` um اَنعَم is the plural of Ni'mah نِعمَۃ . The meanings of these words are that the process of gradual development continues until all the faculties reach their peak and this happens when a person is in the prime of his youth.</p><p>أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ (The worst part of the age - 22:5). It means the stage of life when human faculties and senses begin to degenerate. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had sought Allah's protection from such life. Nasa'i has quoted Sayyidna Sa'd ؓ as saying that the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to repeat the following prayer very frequently. (Qurtubi):</p><p>اللَّھُمَّ اِنِّی اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ البُخَلِ واَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ الجُبنِ وَ اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ اَن اُرَدَّ اِلٰی اَرذَلِ العُمرِ وَ اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ فِتنَۃِ الدُّنیَا وَ عَذَابِ القَبرِ</p><p>(0 Allah! I seek Your protection from miserliness, and I seek Your protection from cowardice, and I seek Your protection from that I am carried to the age of helplessness, and I seek Your protection from the seductions of this world and the chastisement of the grave.)</p><p>An account of the different stages of human life after birth</p><p>Musnad of Ahmad and Musnad of Abu Ya` la quote Sayyidna 'Anas Ibn Malik ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said \"The good deeds of a minor child are recorded in the account of his father or both his parents, but his evil deeds are not recorded, neither in his parents' account nor in his own. After he has attained majority, an account is opened in his own name and the two angels who are attached to him are commanded to afford him protection and provide him strength. When he reaches the age of forty years and is still a Muslim, then Allah Ta’ ala grants him immunity from three diseases: insanity, leprosy and leucoderma. When he reaches the age of fifty years, Allah eases and abates his record. At the age of sixty, Allah Ta’ ala creates in him an urge to turn his thoughts towards Him. At seventy, all the inhabitants of the sky begin to love him. When he is eighty, Allah Ta’ ala records his good deeds but ignores his lapses. At ninety, Allah writes off all his sins, and grants him permission to intercede on behalf of his relatives and also accepts his intercession. He is then given the titles of اَمِین اللہ (Allah's trustee) and اَسِیرَ اللہ فی الارض (that is the prisoner of Allah on earth, because at that age all his strength is gone, he loses interest in his surroundings and spends his life like a prisoner). And when he reaches the worst of age, then all the good deeds which he used to perform when he was strong and healthy continue to be recorded in his account while his sinful acts remain unrecorded.\"</p><p>Having reproduced this tradition from Musnad Abu Ya` la, Hafiz Ibn Kathir says:</p><p>ھٰذاحَدِیث غَرِیب جِدَّاً و فِیہ نکارۃ شدیدہ</p><p>This hadith is gharb (i.e. reported by one narrator only), and is extremely munkar (i.e. reported by a weak narrator against the authentic traditions).</p><p>He then adds:</p><p>و مع ھذا قد رواہ الامام احمد بن حنبل فی مسندہٖ موقوفاً و مرفوعاً</p><p>(And in spite of all this Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (رح) has related it in his Musnad both as a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and as a saying of a Sahabi, that is traced.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Different stages in the development of foetus in mother's womb</p><p>فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن تُرَ‌ابٍ (We created you from dust - 22:5.) This verse deals with the different stages through which the foetus passes in its mother's womb before taking a human form. There is a detailed hadith on this subject, which is reproduced in Sahih of Bukhari on the authority of Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ to the effect that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said, \"Human matter retains its original form in the woman's womb for forty days after which it becomes a clot of blood. After a further period of forty days it becomes a lump of flesh. Thereafter an angel is sent by Allah Ta’ ala who breaths a soul into it and records four things about it, namely how long it will live, how much sustenance it will receive, what acts he will do, and finally whether its end will be wretched or fortunate. (Qurtubi)</p><p>There is another narration which has been related by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir, also on the authority of ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ ، that when the seed becomes a lump of flesh after passing through different stages, the angel responsible to watch the progressive development of each individual then seeks guidance from Allah Ta’ ala saying: یَارَبّ مُخَلَّقَۃ او غیر مُخَلَّقۃ . That is, whether it is His will that the lump of flesh should be allowed to grow and become a living human being. If Allah says it is: غَیر مُخَلَّقۃ then the womb aborts the foetus and it does not reach the higher stages leading to a live birth. On the other hand, if Allah says that it is: مُخَلَّقۃ then the angel asks Him whether it is to be a boy or a girl, wretched or fortunate, how long it will live, how it will spend its life and when it will die. The angel is given information on all these matters then and there. (Ibn Kathir) Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas\tرضی اللہ تعالیٰ عنہما has also interpreted the words (مُخَلَّقَۃ او غیر مُخَلَّقۃ) in a similar manner. (Qurtubi)</p><p>مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ‌ مُخَلَّقَةٍ (shaped or unshaped - 22:5). It is evident from the hadith referred to above that the human seed which completes its full term in the womb and is destined to be born as a normal human being is meant by\t(shaped), whereas a seed which is destined to be aborted is (unshaped). However, there are other commentators who have explained these two words differently. According to them a foetus which completes all the stages of growth and development and whose limbs and other organs of the body are healthy, normal and proportionate ism (shaped). On the other hand, a foetus whose limbs are deformed or disproportionate is غَيْرِ‌ مُخَلَّقَةٍ (unshaped). The latter interpretation is close to the translation adopted above. Allah knows best.</p><p>ثُمَّ نُخْرِ‌جُكُمْ طِفْلًا Then We bring you out as babies - 22:5) Then Allah brings forth the baby from its mother's womb as a totally helpless thing. Its body is weak and so are its other faculties, such as hearing, vision, senses, brain function, and overall physical movements including its grasp. All theses faculties grow strong as time passes until they reach their full capability. This is the meaning of the words ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوا أَشُدَّكُمْ. (Then [ We nourish you ] so that you reach your maturity - 22:5). The word Ashudd اَشُد is the plural of shiddah شِدَّہ ، just as An` um اَنعَم is the plural of Ni'mah نِعمَۃ . The meanings of these words are that the process of gradual development continues until all the faculties reach their peak and this happens when a person is in the prime of his youth.</p><p>أَرْ‌ذَلِ الْعُمُرِ‌ (The worst part of the age - 22:5). It means the stage of life when human faculties and senses begin to degenerate. The Holy Prophet ﷺ had sought Allah's protection from such life. Nasa'i has quoted Sayyidna Sa'd ؓ as saying that the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to repeat the following prayer very frequently. (Qurtubi):</p><p>اللَّھُمَّ اِنِّی اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ البُخَلِ واَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ الجُبنِ وَ اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ اَن اُرَدَّ اِلٰی اَرذَلِ العُمرِ وَ اَعُوذُ بِکَ مِنَ فِتنَۃِ الدُّنیَا وَ عَذَابِ القَبرِ</p><p>(0 Allah! I seek Your protection from miserliness, and I seek Your protection from cowardice, and I seek Your protection from that I am carried to the age of helplessness, and I seek Your protection from the seductions of this world and the chastisement of the grave.)</p><p>An account of the different stages of human life after birth</p><p>Musnad of Ahmad and Musnad of Abu Ya` la quote Sayyidna 'Anas Ibn Malik ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said \"The good deeds of a minor child are recorded in the account of his father or both his parents, but his evil deeds are not recorded, neither in his parents' account nor in his own.

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>In verse 17 it is stated that Allah will decide among the believers and non-believers of different faiths on the Day of Resurrection, because He knows everything. What that decision would be, has been related in the Qur'an at several places, namely that the good Muslims will enjoy a life of everlasting peace and comfort, while the infidels would be condemned to a life of eternal perdition. In the next verse, by using the word \"Sajdah\" (prostration), it has been declared that all created things, be they living things, minerals or plants, are in obedience and thus submit to the Supreme authority of Allah Ta’ ala, thereby mentioning two groups of humans in this respect of 'submission'. One, which obeys Allah and therefore is included amongst the creatures who 'prostrate' to Him, and the other one which is rebellious and refuses to bow before Him, meaning, refusing to submit to His Will. The word \"Sajdah\" (prostration) has been used here in the broader sense of 'submission' to the will of Allah and obeying His commands, because all created things act upon this submission in their own way. Human beings perform Sajdah by touching the ground with the forehead, while in the case of other created things their Sajdah constitutes their faithful performance of the functions assigned to them by Allah.</p><p>The truth about all created things obeying Allah</p><p>Genetically, the entire universe and all created things therein are under, the control and subject to the Will of their Creator by virtue of an inherently programmed guidance (guidance of Takwin) by Allah. The 'submission' in this sense is pre-determined, involuntary and instinctive. There is no created being which can escape this universal law of creation, be it a Muslim or a non-believer, a living thing or dead, mineral or plant. The smallest particle and the highest mountain cannot make the slightest movement without His Will. There is, however, another kind of submission to Allah, when a person offers homage to Him voluntarily and without constraint. This is what distinguishes a believer from a non-believer. A believer is obedient and sincere in his submission to Allah, whereas a non-believer repudiates His existence. As this verse deals with the difference between a Muslim and a kafir (infidel), it is more likely that reference to 'Sajdah' (prostration) does not refer to pre-destined and instinctive obedience alone but covers the voluntary submission as well. Let it not be supposed that only human beings and Jinns who possess intelligence can offer voluntary and unconstrained submission, and animals, plants and minerals being devoid of reason cannot exercise voluntary and intentional obedience. Indeed it can be proved from the text of the Qur'an that every created thing has reason, intellect and intent, and the difference lies only in degree. Human beings and Jinns possess a perfect level of intelligence, which makes them liable to a strict adherence to the laws governing what is permissible and what is forbidden. As regards other creatures, Allah has given them intelligence according to their needs. Animals possess the highest degree of intelligence after humans, then come plants and last of all are the minerals. The intelligence among the animals can easily be perceived, and that possessed by plants can also be observed if one applies one's mind to the task. However, the intelligence given to the minerals is so little and concealed that it is not easily discernible, though Allah has said clearly that they not only possess intelligence but also have the capacity to decide things. The Qur'an says about the sky and the earth قَالَتَا أَتَيْنَا طَائِعِينَ (They said, \"We come willingly.\"41:11) that is, when Allah commanded the sky and the earth that they must submit to His Will either by their free choice or by force, they both replied that they accepted His authority by their own voluntary choice. At another place the Qur'an says وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّـهِ , (and there are still others which fall down in fear of Allah. - 2:74) which means that there are rocks, which fall down in fear of Allah Ta’ ala. Similarly, there are numerous traditions which provide evidence of mountains conversing with one another, or other created things showing signs of intelligence. Therefore, the homage mentioned in this verse for which the word Sajdah (Prostration) has been used means the voluntary homage. The interpretation of this verse would, then, be that except for the human beings and Jinns all other created things voluntarily and willingly submit to the Divine Authority. It is only the human beings and Jinns who are divided into two factions, namely those who bow in submission to the Will of Allah, and those who deny His authority and refuse to submit to Him and are, therefore, despised.

In the ensuing fight the three unbelievers were slain, Sayyidna and Hamzah ؓ emerged unscathed, while Sayyidna ` Ubaidah ؓ was mortally wounded and expired at the feet of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . The revelation of this verse in relation to these warriors of the field of Badr is well established on the authority of traditions contained in Bukhari and Muslim, but it is evident that its message is not exclusive for them alone, but embraces the entire Muslim community of all times and ages.</p>"

      "text": "<p>The philosophy of adorning the dwellers of Paradise with gold bracelets</p><p>Here a point may arise that bracelets are articles of jewellery worn by women only and their use by men is looked upon with disfavor. This objection is not entirely relevant because throughout ages monarchs have embellished their persons with costly jewellery, crowns and bracelets as symbols of their might and wealth. The story is well known that Suraqah Ibn Malik ؓ ، before his conversion to Islam, started out in pursuit of the Holy Prophet ﷺ in order to apprehend him while he was on his way from Makkah to Madinah. As he approached near the Holy Prophet ﷺ his horse sank, by Allah's Will, in a piece of treacherous sand. At that critical moment he expressed his repentance about his error and sinful way, and begged the Holy Prophet ﷺ to pray for his deliverance from his predicament. When, as a result of the Holy Prophet's ﷺ prayer, his horse was extracted from the quicksand, he promised Suraqah Ibn Malik ؓ that when the bracelets of the King of Persia would fall in the hands of the Muslims as spoils of war, they would be given to him. So, when during the caliphate of Sayyidna ` Umar' ؓ the Muslims conquered Persia and the bracelets worn by the King of Persia were brought to Madinah along with other spoils of war Suraqah Ibn Malik ؓ laid claim to them and received them from Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ . In brief, just as wearing a crown is a royal privilege and not a common practice among men, similarly wearing bracelets by men is a royal privilege, and thus the men admitted to heaven will wear them as a symbol of honour and Divine favour. According to this verse, and also Surah Fatir, the bracelets will be made of gold, but in Surah Nisa' it is said that they will be made of silver. For this reason commentators are of the view that the bracelets worn by the pious people in heaven will be of three kinds, that is made of gold, silver and pearls. This verse makes a mention of bracelets made of pearls also.</p><p>Silk clothes are forbidden for men</p><p>The verse says that those people who are admitted to Paradise will wear silk clothes which means that their dresses, carpets, curtains etc. will be made of silk, which is regarded as the best fabric in this world. However, it should be understood that the silk used in Paradise and the silk used in this world have only the name in common, otherwise from the point of view of quality there is no comparison between the two.</p><p>Imam Nasa'i, Bazzar and Baihaqi رحمۃ اللہ علیہم have related on the authority of Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ that once the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that the clothes of the people living in Paradise will be made from silk, which will be extracted from a fruit growing there. There is also a statement by Sayyidna Jabir ؓ that there would be a tree in the Paradise which would produce silk and the people of Paradise would wear dresses made from it. (Mazhari)</p><p>In a hadith quoted by Imam Nasa'i (رح) on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said:</p><p>مَن لَبِسَ الحرِیر فی الدّنیا لم یلبسہ فی الآخرہ، و من شَرِبَ الخمر فی الدّنیا لم یَشرِبھا فی الآخرہ، ومن شرب فی اٰنیۃ الذّھب و الفضّہ لم یشرب فیھا فی الآخرۃ، ثمّ قال رسول اللہ ﷺ لباس اھل الجنّۃ واٰنیۃ اھل الجنّۃ</p><p>\"He who wears silk in this world will not wear it in the Hereafter; he who drinks wine in this world will be deprived of the sacred nectar in the Hereafter; he who uses utensils made of precious metals for food and drink in this world will be denied their use in the Hereafter.\" Then the Holy Prophet ﷺ added \" These three things are exclusively for the people of Paradise.\" (Qurtubi quoting Nasa'i)</p><p>The meaning is that a person who spent his life in this world in the midst of these three luxuries and did not show contrition, would be deprived of them even if he were admitted to Paradise. According to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that a person who drank wine in this world and did not repent would be deprived of the sacred nectar of the Paradise in the Hereafter. (Qurtubi)</p><p>According to Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ there is another hadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p>مَن لَبِسَ الحرِیر فی الدّنیا لم یلبسہ فی الآخرہ، و ان دخل الجنّۃ، لبسہ اھل الجنّۃ ولم یلبسہ ھو (رواہ ابو داؤد الطیالسی فی مسندہ وقال القرطبی اسنادہ صحیح)</p><p>\"He who wore silk in the world will not wear it in the Hereafter even if he is admitted to Paradise. All other people of Paradise will wear silk, but not he.\"</p><p>Here a point arises that if after admittance to Paradise a person remained deprived of something, he will nourish a sense of sorrow and grief, whereas Paradise is no place for such feelings, because everyone who is admitted to Paradise should at all times be easy in his mind and free from anxiety. On the other hand, if the deprivation of certain facilities causes no sorrow and grief, then the deprivation loses its purpose. Qurtubi has given a very convincing explanation to this matter. He says that the people of Paradise will be given different grades and places at different levels, depending on how well they stood in Allah's favour on account of their good deeds and devotion to the cause of the True Faith. Everybody will be aware of these differences, but Allah will fill their hearts with tranquility and contentment, so that they will not feel grief and sorrow about these differences: وَاللہُ سبحانَہُ و تعالیٰ اَعلَم</p>"

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>In the previous verse, mention was made of the mutual hostility between the believers and infidels. One aspect of this hostility has been described in this verse, namely that among the infidels there are those who not only persist in error themselves but also prevent others from following the path of virtue. Those were the people who prevented the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions when they wanted to enter the Sacred Mosque wearing the pilgrim's garb. Traditionally the Sacred Mosque and that part of Makkah which has an essential role in the rituals of the pilgrimage was not their property and they had no right to deny entry to anyone. The place is open to everyone, whether a local resident or a visitor. The verse goes on to say that anyone who commits an impious act in the Sacred Mosque, (meaning the whole of حَرَم Haram), such as preventing people from entering the Mosque, will be made to suffer severe chastisement from Allah, especially if he is also a polytheist as was the case with the infidels of Makkah. They will be liable for double punishment, one for being non-believers and second for preventing others to enter the Sacred Mosque for pilgrimage. Although all sinful acts especially shirk and kufr are forbidden and are great crimes and sins which are liable to punishment at all times and in all places, but such acts carried out in the حَرَم Haram enhance the crime double-fold, and hence referred here for their special importance.</p><p>يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّـهِ (Prevent (people) from the way of Allah - 22:25) The words سَبِيلِ اللَّـهِ (the way of Allah) mean Islam and the sense of the verse is that these people not only repudiate Islam themselves but also prevent others from accepting it.</p><p>Their second offence is that they stop the Muslims from entering the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) (22:25). In reality Al-Masjid Al-Haram is the name of the mosque which is built around بَیت اللہ (House of Allah - the Holy Ka'bah), and it is a very important part of حَرَم haram of Makkah. However, the term Al-Masjid Al-Haram is usually used for the whole of haram of Makkah, as is the case under this episode. Thus the infidels of Makkah excluded the Muslims not only from the Sacred Mosque but also from the precincts of haram of Makkah (as is evident from numerous traditions), and the words اَلمَسجِد الحَرَام used in this verse cover the entire haram. The Holy Qur'an has at another place used the word اَلمَسجِد الحَرَام under this episode in the meaning of the whole area of حَرَم Haram: وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَ‌امِ. (48:25)</p><p>The meaning of equal rights of all Muslims within Haram of Makkah</p><p>According to al-Durr al-Manthur the term Al-Masjid Al-Haram in the present context means the entire haram as reported from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ . The entire Muslim Ummah and all the jurists are unanimous on the fact that all those areas of Makkah and the haram where the essential rituals of the pilgrimage are performed, such as the space between Safa and Marwah, where the pilgrims perform سَعِی Sa'y, and all the open areas of Mina, ` Arafat and Muzdalifah are waqf for the benefit of the entire Muslim ummah and have never been, nor can ever be, owned by individuals. Some jurists apply this principle to the private houses in Makkah and the open lands in the area of haram to infer that these too are waqf for all the Muslims, that a Muslim can stay anywhere he likes and that the sale or letting out these properties on rent is not permissible. However, there are other jurists who do not accept this view and believe that the ownership of these properties can vest in private individuals and the houses can be sold or let out on rent. It is well established that Sayyidna ` Umar ؓ purchased the house of Safwan Ibn Umayyah in Makkah for use as prison for the criminals. As for Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) ، both views are attributed to him in different reports, but the hanaff jurists have issued their Fatwa (ruling) in favour of the latter view. (Ruh ul-Ma` ani) This verse mentions certain areas of haram where entry was denied to the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his companions by the infidels of Makkah, but these areas are waqf by consensus of ummah and nobody can be denied access to them.</p><p>وَمَن يُرِ‌دْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ (And whoever intends therein to commit deviation with injustice - 22:25.) The word إِلْحَادٍ literally means deviation from the right path. While Mujahid and Qatadah have interpreted this word to mean unbelief and denial of the Oneness of Allah (kufr and shirk) other commentators have given this word its literal meaning which embraces all kinds of sins so much so that even hurling abuses to one's servant is also included in it.</p><p>Sayyidna ` Ata' ؓ has further enlarged the scope of the meaning of this word by declaring that ilhad within the precincts of haram means entering it without wearing the pilgrims garb (ihram), or violating any of the prohibition inside the haram, such as hunting or cutting down trees within its limits. It needs to be clarified here that all things forbidden by the religious code are forbidden everywhere and will attract punishment wherever committed; and the specific reference to haram in this verse is to emphasize the fact that just as a good deed performed within its limits will be generously rewarded, similarly a sin committed there will attract the most severe punishment. (Mujahid). Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Masud ؓ has related another interpretation of the word ilhad to mean that whereas at any other place the mere intention to commit a sin does not constitute a sin unless it is actually committed, within the limits of the haram even the resolve to commit a sin is punishable, as if it has actually been committed. Qurtubi has adopted this interpretation from Ibn ` Umar ؓ and lends his own support to it. Whenever Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ went for the pilgrimage, he used to set up two tents - one within the limits of haram and the other outside it. If ever an occasion arose when he needed to scold or rebuke any one of his households, he would do it in the tent which he had set up outside the limits of haram. When people asked him the reason for this, his answer was that the words کلَّا واللہ or بلٰی واللہ\twhich a person normally uses when angry also constitute إلحَاد فی الحَرَم (committing an act of sin within the precincts of haram).

The word بَوَّء literally means ` to assign to someone a place for his residence.' The verse calls to attention the fact that Allah assigned to Sayyidna Ibrahim\tعلیہ السلام a place where Baitullah was located. There is a hint here that he was not settled there already, since he migrated here from Syria. And a reference to مَکَانَ البَیت (the place of the House) suggests that the House of Allah pre-existed the arrival of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) ، because according to reliable traditions its first foundations were laid about the time when Sayyidna 'Adam (علیہ السلام) was sent upon the earth and he, and the prophets who came after him, used to make tawaf (circumambulation) around it. At the time of Deluge in the days of Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) its upper-structure was removed but the foundations remained intact. Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) was brought to this place and commanded by Allah Ta’ ala أَن لَّا تُشْرِ‌كْ بِي شَيْئًا (Do not associate with Me any one - 22:26). It is quite evident that Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) could not commit shirk, because he had himself suffered considerable torment at the hands of polytheists after they accused him of having destroyed their idols. The intention here is to warn the people at large against the great sin of polytheism. The second command was وَطَهِّرْ‌ بَيْتِيَ (purify My House - 22:26), even though the House of Allah did not exist at that time. But the fact of the matter is that Baitullah is not just a structure of bricks and mortar, rather the term encompasses that entire piece of sacred land where Baitullah once stood and whose structure Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) was now commanded to raise once again on the original foundations. As for the command to purify the place, Qurtubi says that in those days the tribes of Jurhum (جُرھَم) and Amalakites (عمالقہ) had placed idols there, which they worshipped. (Qurtubi) Another view is that this command is for the future generations not only to keep the place free from infidelity and polytheism but also to pay special attention to its external cleanliness and purity.</p>"

Ibn Abi Hatim has related from Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ that when Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) was commanded by Allah to make this proclamation, he submitted that the place where he stood was an uninhabited desolate plane with nobody to hear the proclamation whereas he lacked the means to convey it to the populated areas. Allah Ta’ ala then told him that he was required only to make the proclamation and the responsibility for conveying it to the four corners of the world rested with Himself, that is Allah Ta’ ala. Thereupon Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) stood at مقام ابراھیم (Station of Ibrahim) and made the proclamation and Allah Ta’ ala magnified his voice so that it was heard all round the earth. It is also related that he made the proclamation from the top of the mount Abu Qubais (جبل أبی قبَیس). He put his fingers in his ears, turned his face in four directions and called out \"0 people! Allah has established His House and made it obligatory upon you to make pilgrimage to it. So obey the command of your Lord.\"</p><p>It is also mentioned in this narration that Allah Ta’ ala so decreed that the announcement was heard miraculously all over the world, not only by the people living then, but also by all those yet to be born upto the Day of Resurrection. And all those who are destined to perform the pilgrimage responded to the call with the words اللَّھُمَّ لَبَّیک لَبَّیک . Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ says that the Talbiyah during the pilgrimage has its origin in this response to the call of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) . (Qurtubi, Mazhari)</p><p>Further on, the verse describes the tradition which has been established for all times as a result of the proclamation of Sayyidna Ibrahim namely يَأْتُوكَ رِ‌جَالًا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ‌ يَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٍ (22:28) meaning that people will come to Baitullah from the four corners of the earth, some on foot and others on their mounts, which will become lean because of the long distances traversed by them. From that remote time until today, though thousands of years have elapsed, people come to Baitullah to perform pilgrimage, just as they did in the earliest times. All the prophets who came after Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) and their followers strictly observed this tradition. During the long period of ignorance after Sayyidna ` Isa' (علیہ السلام) ، the Arabs, even though they lapsed into the evils of idolatry, yet they continued to perform very faithfully all the rituals of the pilgrimage precisely as they had inherited them from the time of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) .</p>"

      "text": "<p>لِّيَشْهَدُوا مَنَافِعَ لَهُمْ (So that they witness benefits for them - 22:28) means that the arduous journey undertaken by people to perform pilgrimage is to their own advantage. The use of the word \"benefits\" as a common noun (without definite article) points to the universal benefits that may be derived from the pilgrimage. Apart from the spiritual rewards, many material profits may also be obtained. It is indeed remarkable that people who sedulously save pennies over long years in order to be able to defray the high expenses involved in performing the Hajj have never become insolvent, whereas many people are known to have become bankrupt as a result of expenses incurred on marriages or on the construction of palatial houses. It is a common knowledge that no one has become a pauper because of spending on Hajj or ` Umrah, rather it has been noticed, according to some narrations, that Allah Ta’ ala has bestowed such a blessing in this worship that many have gained materially after the ritual. As for the spiritual gains, they are many, one being related by Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ in a hadith in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ said that anyone who performed Hajj in order to gain Allah's favour and avoided sins and obscene acts will return as immaculate and innocent as a newborn baby. (Bukhari and Muslim) (Mazhari)</p><p>In addition to the spiritual and material benefits to be obtained from Hajj mentioned above, there is yet another advantage which may be gained when performing it, which is mentioned in the following sentence: وَيَذْكُرُ‌وا اسْمَ اللَّـهِ فِي أَيَّامٍ مَّعْلُومَاتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَ‌زَقَهُم مِّن بَهِيمَةِ الْأَنْعَامِ (so that they may recite Allah's name, in specified days, over the provision He gave them from the cattle - 22:28). Here it is important to bear in mind that the main object of sacrificing the animals on this occasion is not their meat, but the mention of Allah's name which is recited while the animal is being slaughtered, which is the essence of the worship. The fact that eating the meat of these animals has been made halal (lawful) for them is an additional reward from Allah. أَيَّامٍ مَّعْلُومَاتٍ (specified days) refer to the 10th, 11th, and 12th days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah when animals may be sacrificed. The words عَلَىٰ مَا رَ‌زَقَهُم مِّن بَهِيمَةِ الْأَنْعَامِ (Over the provision He gave them from the cattle - 22:28) are of general application and include all kinds of sacrifices whether they are obligatory or optional.</p><p>فَكُلُوا مِنْهَا So eat there from) Although the word كُلُوا has been used in the imperative mood, it does not mean that eating the meat of these animals is obligatory. Rather, it has been used in the sense that it is permitted and lawful to eat this meat, as it is mentioned in verse وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَاصْطَادُوا (When you are out of Ihram, you may hunt - 5:2) for granting permission for hunting.</p><p>Ruling</p><p>Specially during the period of Hajj, and generally at other times too situations arise when animals must be sacrificed in Makkah . There is one kind of sacrifice which is obligatory and performed to expiate a sin such as killing animals within the precincts of حَرَم Haram. Books of jurisprudence describe in detail the kind of animals killed and the type of animals to be slaughtered to atone for each such animal killed unlawfully. Similarly, if a person commits an act which is forbidden, as long as he is in the state of ihram, he too must slaughter an animal. Jurists call this kind of sacrifice as a دَم الجنَایَہ (sacrifice to atone for a sin). Here also there are specific rules governing each situation. There are certain irregularities which must be expiated by slaughtering a camel or a cow, while in other cases the sacrifice of a goat or sheep is considered sufficient. There are a third kind of irregularities where slaughter of an animal is not necessary, and one can redeem his error by offering sadaqah. This is not the place to discuss these matters in great detail, but the the necessary information on this subject can be found in my booklet Ahkamul-Hajj (احکَام الحج). When an animal is slaughtered for expiating a sin or an irregular act, its meat can be eaten only by the poor and needy persons and it is not permissible for the person making the slaughter or any rich person to eat this meat, and this view is held by all the jurists. As regards other sacrifices, whether obligatory or voluntary, the person offering the sacrifice, his relatives and friends, even though they may be rich, can eat their meat; and the present verse refers to this kind of sacrifice. Here also it is recommended that one-third of the meat be distributed among the poor and needy. The second part of this verse وَأَطْعِمُوا الْبَائِسَ الْفَقِيرَ‌ (and feed the distressed, the poor</p><p>- 22:28) explains this point.</p>"

      "text": "<p>ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُوا (Then, they must remove their dirt - 22:29) The word تَفَث means dirt, which gathers on human body. While a person is in the state of ihram, he cannot shave, trim or pluck his hair, nor can he pare his nails, nor use perfume, and it is quite natural that dirt should collect under his hair and nails and on his body. This verse requires of the pilgrims that after they have performed the sacrifice, they should remove this dirt, meaning thereby that they should now remove the ihram, (and wear their normal clothes) shave their heads and pare their nails. This verse mentions sacrifice first and then refers to the removal of the dirt, which suggests that these two acts must be performed in that order. It is forbidden to shave one's head or pare nails before the obligatory sacrifice. Anyone who does so must slaughter an animal as دَم dam (to atone for his sin).</p><p>Observance of the correct sequence in the performance of various acts related to Hajj</p><p>The observance of various functions of Hajj in the same order in which they are mentioned in the Qur'an and hadith, and which have been codified by the jurists is, by consensus, a sunnah. However, opinions differ whether it is obligatory as well. Imam Abu Hanifah (رح) and Imam Malik (رح) hold the view that the observance of the sequence is obligatory and any deviation from it must be atoned for by دَم dam, while according to Imam Shafi'i (رح) it is only sunnah and a deviation from it reduces the reward to be gained by performing Hajj but does not make it obligatory to sacrifice an animal. There is also a ruling of Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ مَن قَدَّم شیٔاً من نسکہ او اخّرہ فلیھرق دما (He who alters the sequence of the rites during Hajj must slaughter an animal). (Mazhari) Tahawi has also reported this tradition through different versions. In addition Sayyidna Said Ibn Jubair ؓ ، Qatadah, Nakha` i and Hasan al-Basri also support the view that any alteration in the sequence of the rites of Hajj makes the sacrifice of an animal obligatory. Fuller details on the subject are discussed in the Tafsir Mazhari.</p><p>وَلْيُوفُوا نُذُورَ‌هُمْ (And fulfill their vows - 22:29) نُذُور is the plural of the word نَذَر ، which means a ` vow'. When a person commits himself verbally to do an act, in order to win the goodwill of Allah Ta’ ala, (which is not otherwise obligatory on him) it becomes a vow (nadhr) and its performance becomes obligatory for him by consensus of Ummah, provided that the act itself is not sinful or forbidden. If a person makes a vow to do something which is sinful, then he is not bound to fulfill the vow, rather it is impermissible to act upon it, but he must make atonement for the unfulfilled vow. According to Abu Hanifah (رح) and other religious jurists the vow must be of an act which is an act of a direct worship (` ibadah maqsudah) in some manner. So, if someone makes a nadhr (vow) for voluntary prayers, fasting, sadaqah, sacrifice, of animals etc. all these vows must be fulfilled in all circumstances. The present verse emphasizes on this very issue.</p><p>Ruling</p><p>It must be remembered that a resolve made in one's heart to do something does not become a nadhr (vow) unless it is pronounced with the tongue. Tafsfr Mazhari has elaborated the rules of nadhr in great detail.</p><p>A question and its answer</p><p>One may question the relevance of nadhr in the context of Hajj. Obviously the preceding sentences speak of the rules of Hajj, like sacrifice, removing ihram etc. Similarly, the following sentence relates to the tawaf of ziyarah. Why the injunction to fulfill vows has been inserted between the rules of Hajj, while the rules governing vows have an independent status which are to be fulfilled at all times and at every place and not during Hajj only?</p><p>A possible explanation for this is that when a person sets out with the intention of performing Hajj, his heart prompts him to do the maximum number of good deeds and to spend the maximum time in prayers, and so he makes many vows, specially it was a common practice to make vows for sacrificing additional animals during Hajj. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ the word nadhr in this context means a vow to sacrifice an animal. One relevance of nadhr (vow) appearing with the rites of pilgrimage is that just as vow makes many things obligatory which are not so otherwise and makes many things unlawful for him which are not originally forbidden, similarly the state of ihram, during a pilgrimage makes certain things unlawful for him which are permitted at other times. Instances of these are: wearing stitched clothes, use of perfume, shaving of hair or paring nails. Therefore, Sayyidna ` Ikrimah ؓ has interpreted nadhr in this verse to mean those acts and duties which have become obligatory during the course of Hajj.</p><p>وَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا بِالْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ (And they should make tawaf of the ancient House - 22:29) Here the word tawaf refers to tawaf-uz-ziyarah, which is performed on the 10th day of the month of Zil Hijj after casting stones and making the sacrifice. It is the second obligatory ritual of Hajj, the first being wuquf-ul-` Arafat, which is performed earlier. After this tawaf the state of ihram is fully terminated and all restrictions are removed. (Rah ul-Ma ani)</p><p>The word الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ lexically means 'liberated house' Baitullah is called الْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ , because according to the Holy Prophet ﷺ it has been liberated from the control and domination of the infidels and tyrants and it will never again be ruled by them. (رواہ الترمذی وحسنہ والحاکم وصححہ وابن جریر والطبرانی۔Ruh ul-Ma'ani). It is evident by the episode of the People of Elephant who, with all their might, were frustrated in their attempt to establish their dominion over Makkah.1</p><p>1. The other meaning of the word عَتِیق is 'ancient' which is adopted in the translation of the text. (Editor)</p>"

It means that it is lawful for the Muslims to use the quadruped animals for their benefit (such as using their milk, riding them or using them for transport of goods) unless the animals have been made ھَدِی (Hady) by reserving them for sacrifice to be offered within the precincts of haram. When a person takes along with him an animal for the specific purpose of sacrificing it within haram, the animal is described as hady, and no benefit may be derived from it, except in extreme emergency.

Thus the entire haram is declared as the slaughtering place of the animals of hady. The meaning of the verse is that the hady (animals nominated for sacrifice during Hajj) may be slaughtered within, and not outside the area of haram which includes Mina and all other places of Makkah.

This word has been used in the Qur'an at several places and conveys one of the three meanings. In the present context, the word can carry all the three meanings. Mujahid and some other commentators think that here the word مَنسَكً refers to the sacrifice of the animals in which case the verse would mean that the obligation to offer sacrifice, which has been placed on this Ummah is nothing new, because all the other peoples were likewise bound to do so. On the other hand, according to Qatadah the word means the rites of the pilgrimage, and thus the verse would mean that these rites which have been prescribed for the present Ummah were made obligatory on the people of earlier ages also. Ibn ` Arafah has interpreted the word مَنسَكً to mean worship of Allah, and so the meaning of the verse would be that the worship of Allah was made obligatory on all the peoples of bygone ages and though there were differences in the forms of worship, yet in essence it remained unchanged.</p><p>وَبَشِّرِ‌ الْمُخْبِتِينَ (And give good news to those who turn to Him in humbleness). The word\t خَبت means ‘a depressed tract of land’ and means ` a person who deems himself humble and lowly'. According to ` Amr bin Aws مُخْبِتِينَ are those people who do not wrong others and if somebody wrongs them, they do not seek revenge. Sufyan has observed that they are the people who are contented with Allah's will and remain agreeable in all circumstances, comfort or trouble and poverty or affluence.</p>"

It has been explained earlier that شَعَائِرِ‌ (symbols) mean those special forms of rites and worship, which are the symbols of Islam. Sacrifice of animals is one of them, which must be observed with due importance.</p><p>فَاذْكُرُ‌وا اسْمَ اللَّـهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَافَّ (So recite the name of Allah over them as they are lined up (for sacrifice) - 22:36) The word صَوَافَّ (translated above as 'lined up' ) is used for مَصفوُفہ ، which means standing in a row. According to Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn ` Umar ؓ the verse means that the camel, which is to be slaughtered, should stand on three legs and one foreleg should be bent and tied up. This is a better way of slaughtering a camel and is according to sunnah. Other animals should be slaughtered in lying position, which is also sunnah.</p><p>mmmm</p><p>فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا (Then, once their flanks fall down).

These two words have been clarified further by the words قَانِعَ and مُعْتَرَّ‌. The word قَانِعَ applies to a needy person who does not solicit and is content with what people offer him voluntarily.

Its real aim is to recite the name of Allah and to comply with His commands with true devotion. This rule applies to all forms of worship. For instance, the object of prayers is not just the movement of limbs, or the object of fasting is not merely a denial of food and drink.

Many scholars are of the view that this verse is a clear evidence of the fact that accession to power of the four Caliphs (خُلفَاے راشدین) is a direct fulfillment of Allah's Prophesy, and the system of caliphate which was set up by them was in accordance with His will. (Ruh ul-Ma’ ani)</p><p>Having discussed the factual aspect of the circumstances leading up to the revelation of this verse it must, at the same time, be emphasized that where the Qur'an uses general words and phrases, their purpose is not restricted to a particular situation, but is universally applicable to all similar situations. Following this reasoning, Dahhak says that this verse contains an injunction for all those whom Allah Ta’ ala grants power and authority to do all those things which the Four Caliphs did when they controlled the rule.

The phrase فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ (so that they should have hearts - 22:46) suggests that a person can gain wisdom and intelligence by a careful study of the history of bygone times and an account of people who inhabited this world in different ages. Every event of history holds a lesson for a person who has insight and who does not regard history as a mere record of episodes and occurrences. Ibn Abi Hatim has written in his book اَلتَفَکّر quoting Malik Ibn Dinar (رح) that Allah Ta’ ala commanded Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) to wear shoes made of iron and to hold in his hand a staff made of iron and travel around the earth until his shoes would be worn out and his staff broken down. (Ruh-Ma ani). If this narration is true, then naturally it means to acquire knowledge and lessons from the past.</p>"

This verse can be interpreted in two ways. The first meaning is that the verse refers to the Day of Resurrection and the events which will take place on that day will be so horrifying and of such extreme severity that the day will appear never to end, as if it was equal to one thousand years according to our reckoning. Many commentators have interpreted this verse accordingly.</p><p>The other meaning of the verse is that the Day of Resurrection will in actual fact be so long that it will stretch up to one thousand years of this world. This view is supported by a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ as reported in Musnad of Ahmad and Tirmidhi on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once addressed the poor people of the muhajirin (i.e. those who migrated from Makkah) and said, ` I give you good news about the full refulgence on the Day of Resurrection and that you will be admitted to heaven half a day before the rich and the wealthy, and a day in the Hereafter will be of one thousand years, hence the poor will enter the heaven five hundred years before the wealthy'. Tirmidhi has classified this hadith as 'hasan'. (Mazhari)</p><p>A doubt and its explanation</p><p>There is a verse in Surah Al-Ma'arij which says that the day with your Lord will be equal to fifty thousand years كَانَ مِقْدَارُ‌هُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ. (Whereof the measure is fifty thousand yours - 70:4) This can also be explained by applying either of the two explanations of the present verse and in the first case since every person will suffer different levels of severity, to some it will appear as if he has suffered pain for one thousand years, while to others the period will appear equal to fifty thousand years. If, however, the second explanation is applied to this verse, then there would appear to be a contradiction between the verses where one verse equates the Day of Resurrection to one thousand years and the other to fifty thousand years. But this so-called contradiction has been reconciled by Sayyidna Ashraf ` Ali Thanavi (رح))in his commentary Bayan ul-Qur'an, by saying that this difference may be due to different horizons. Just as we see in our world that the length of day and night is different on different horizons, (on zero latitude it is of 24 hours while at the latitude of 900 it is one year. Likewise it is possible that the length of the Day of Resurrection would be different on different horizons, and if its length right below the day line is one thousand years because of miraculously slow rotation of sun or earth), the areas falling 50 times far from it may have a day 50 times more in length. And Allah knows best.</p>"

For our purpose it is enough to understand that Nabi نَبِيٍّ is a person whom Allah Ta’ ala designates with a mission to reform his people and who receives revelations from Him. He may receive a Scripture and a code of laws or he may be commanded to convey the message of an earlier Book and code of laws. Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and ` Isa' (علیہ السلام) belong to the first category, whereas Sayyidna Harun (علیہ السلام) ، who was directed to propagate the teachings of Torah and the Mosaic Laws, falls in the second category. On the other hand a Rasul رَّ‌سُولٍ is a person who receives from Allah Ta’ ala a Scripture and a code of laws. Thus every رَّ‌سُولٍ Rasul is necessarily a Nabi also, but every Nabi is not a Rasul. These distinctions are applicable to human beings only. That an angel who carries wahy from Allah Ta’ ala is also named as Rasul does not contradict this position.

The present verse was revealed to answer these objections of the infidels. (Ruh ul-Ma’ ani).

The rules of slaughter given to the Holy Prophet ﷺ are independent and self-sufficient and it is not permissible to compare them. with those of an earlier Shari'ah, let alone comparing them with someone's own whims and conjectures. As regards the meat of dead animals, it is well known that its oral use was forbidden in all earlier codes.

Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has adopted this second interpretation also. Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, Qurtubi, Ruh u1-Ma` ani etc. have adopted this meaning of the word, and the context of the verse also lends support to this interpretation. Having said all this, it is evident that the meaning of this verse would be that the infidels and the polytheists who dispute the Islamic code of laws on the ground that their own ancestral religion did not include those laws must understand very clearly that any comparison between the old book or Shari` ah and the new book or Shari` ah is totally misplaced and irrelevant, because Allah Ta` a1a granted to each nation in its own time a special Shari` ah and a Book which was binding upon it until another book or Shari` ah arrived on the scene after which it becomes the duty of all people to follow the new Shari` ah, and if any of its laws are in conflict with the laws of the old Shari` ah, then the new rules shall prevail and the old laws will stand invalidated, and nobody has the right to raise a dispute on this matter with the Prophet ﷺ ، who is the recipient of the latest book and Shari` ah. This is the meaning of the following words of this verse. فَلَا يُنَازِعُنَّكَ فِي الْأَمْرِ‌ (They should never quarrel with you in the matter - 22:67). That is, now that the Holy Prophet has brought a new Book and new code of laws no one has the right to dispute them and create any confusion about them.</p><p>This also shows that there is in fact no inconsistency between the two interpretations of this verse. It is quite possible that this verse was revealed with reference to some specific dispute about the slaughter of animals but since, as a general rule, the words must be interpreted in the sense they are understood by the common people and not in reference to a particular event, the words of this verse can be so construed as to apply to all the laws of Shari'ah. The essence of both the interpretations, therefore is, that since Allah Ta’ ala has given each nation its own particular set of rules where differences as to details do exist, the latest set of rules becomes binding on all peoples, and issues relating to these differences cannot be raised. This is the reason why it has been stated at the end of this verse وَادْعُ إِلَىٰ رَ‌بِّكَ إِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى مُّسْتَقِيمٍ (And do call them to your Lord. Surely, you are on straight Guidance - 22:67) in which the Holy Prophet ﷺ has been advised not to take any notice of the machinations and disputes raised by the infidels but to continue with his mission, because he was following the path of righteousness whereas his opponents were steeped in error.</p><p>A doubt and its answer</p><p>In verse 67 it has been averred that Allah Ta’ ala granted to the earlier nations their own Shari` ah or set of rules, and the Mosaic Code and the Christian Code are instances in point. The Jews and the Christians may, therefore, are that their Codes also being Divine should be allowed to exist alongside of the Islamic Code. But this is a fallacious argument because it is a well established fact that an earlier Shari` ah is cancelled by a subsequent Shari` ah, and this view is reinforced by the following verses in which the infidels who challenge the Islamic Shari` ah have been warned of severe chastisement. وَإِن جَادَلُوكَ فَقُلِ اللَّـهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ (And if they dispute with you, then say, \"Allah knows best what you do.\" - 22:68)</p>"

However, there is a difference of opinion about the present verse. Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and Sufyan Thauri رحمۃ اللہ علیہم are among those who think that the present verse is not a verse of sajdah in the sense that reciting this verse or listening to it does not entail the obligation to offer a sajdah, because the command to 'bow down' in sajdah in the present verse is combined with bowing down in ruku' and this circumstance is a clear indication that in the present context sajdah means the normal sajdah which is performed during the course of prayers. For example all the scholars are unanimously of the opinion that in the verse (And prostrate and bow down (in Ruku' ) with those who bow - 3:43) the sajdah is وَاسْجُدِي وَارْ‌كَعِي مَعَ الرَّ‌اكِعِينَ the normal sajdah of the prayers. However, in the context of the present verse Imam Shafi` i and Imam Ahmad) رحمۃ اللہ علیہم hold contrary views and quote a hadith according to which Surah Hajj enjoys a position of greater merit as compared to other Surahs because of two verses of sajdah occurring in it.

While waging war against the infidels the Muslims make supreme efforts, and for this reason it is called jihad, and حَقّ جِھَادہٖ struggle that is due to Him) means that all these efforts and sacrifices should aim solely at winning the favours and goodwill of Allah Ta’ ala, and be free from all considerations of worldly reward, such as fame or spoils of war.</p><p>Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has explained the phrase 'that is due to Him' by saying that it is to strive to the utmost, If one's capacity in the course of jihad, unmindful of all criticism. Some other commentators have explained the word jihad in this verse to mean that one exerts his utmost effort in carrying out the acts of worship and full obedience to rules of Shari` ah in all sincerity. Dahhak and Muqatil have said that a struggle that is due to Him means to act in Allah's obedience and His worship as due to Him. Sayyidna ` Abdullah Ibn Mubarak ؓ thinks that Jihad means to strive against the temptations (nafs) and its baser desires. Imam Baghawi supports this view on the basis of a hadith which he has from Jabir Ibn ` Abdullah ؓ to the effect that when a group of companions returned from Jihad, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said قدمتم خیر مقدم من الجھاد الاصغرالی الجھاد الاکبر قال : مجاددۃ العبد لھواہ (رواہ البیھقی وقال ھذا اسناد فیہ ضعف) (You have returned from a smaller Jihad to a greater Jihad) meaning thereby that the fight against the temptations of self and baser desires never ceases. Baihaqi has also related this hadith but he is of the opinion that it has some weak narrators, Tafsir Mazhari has adopted this latter interpretation and proceeded to say that the Muslims were in fact fighting against the coarse desires of Self even when they were engaged in jihad against the infidels, but the hadith places it after their return from the jihad, The suggestion here is that though the fight against temptations continued even on the battlefield, it could by tradition and usage be brought to fruition only under the watchful eye of a perfect spiritual guide, that is the Holy Prophet ﷺ .</p><p>The Ummah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the chosen Ummah of Allah Ta’ ala</p><p>هُوَ اجْتَبَاكُمْ (He has chosen you - 22:78) Sayyidna Wathilah Ibn Asqa' ؓ has reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said, ` Allah chose the Kinanah from the children of Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) ، then He chose the Quraish from the Kinanah, then the Bani Hashim from the Quraish and from amongst the Bani Hashim He chose me'. (Muslim - Mazhari).</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَ‌جٍ (And did not impose any hardship on you in the religion - 22:78) It means that Allah Ta’ ala has not imposed any hardship upon you in matters of religion. From this some scholars have concluded that in Islam there is no sin which cannot be forgiven and save a person from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection if he repents for it truly. On the other hand, among the earlier nations there were certain sins which could not be forgiven even by offering repentance.</p><p>According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas\t' ؓ hardship' refers to those rigid and harsh laws which applied to the Bani Isra'il and for which the Qur'an uses the words اِصر (burden) and اِغلَال (shackles). Others have interpreted the word haraj (hardship) to mean a hardship which is beyond human endurance. In Islam there are no such laws and rules which are unbearable in themselves, though there are some rules which entail strenuous effort. But such efforts have always been regarded as pre-requisites to success in all human activities. Education, commerce, industry etc. are fields where success depends on unremitting labour but that would not make these tasks impossible to achieve. Sometimes difficulties are experienced due to unfavorable environments or lack of familiarity with the task in hand, but these too cannot be described as hardships and can be overcome by sustained hard work.</p><p>Another interpretation given by Qadi Thanaullah in Tafsir Mazhari is that Allah Ta’ ala having chosen the Muslims for His favours from amongst all other nations, they too willingly opt for the severest hardship in the service of Allah and His religion. In such a situation even hardships and difficulties do not deter their resilience and they endure them willingly and happily. There is a hadith related by Sayyidna Anas ؓ in which the Holy Prophet\tﷺ said جعلت قرۃ عینی فی الصّلٰوۃ (the coolness of my eyes lies in prayers). (Abmad and Nasai).</p><p>مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ (The faith of your father Ibrahim - 22:78). It means that this is the nation of your father Ibrahim. These words are addressed to the Quraish who are descended from Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) and all other people following them become entitled to the favours which Allah Ta’ ala has granted to the Quraish. There is a hadith which says:</p><p>الناس تبع لقریش فی ھٰذا الشان، مسلمھم تبع لمسلمھم، وکافرھم تبع لکافرھم (رواہ البخاری و مسلم)</p><p>All people follow Quraish in this faith; the believers follow the believers among the Quraish, and the infidels follow the infidels among them. (Mazhari).</p><p>Others say that the words أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ (your father Ibrahim) are addressed to all Muslims in the sense that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was the spiritual father of All Muslims and had himself descended from Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) .</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّاكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِي هَـٰذَا (He (Allah) named you as Muslims both before and in this Qur'an - 22:78) Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) had named the followers of the Holy Prophet ﷺ and all other believers as Muslims even before the Qur'an, and later in the Qur'an itself, as is evident from his prayer which is recorded in the Qur'an: رَ‌بَّنَا وَاجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّ‌يَّتِنَا أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّک (0 our Lord, make us both submissive to you, and of our progeny a people submissive to you - 2:128)</p><p>And the name \"Muslim\" given by the Qur'an to the believers, was, though, not given directly by Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) ، yet since he had suggested this name even before the revelation of the Qur'an, the Holy Qur'an has adopted this name. That is why it is attributed to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) .</p><p>لِيَكُونَ الرَّ‌سُولُ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ (So that the Messenger becomes a witness to you and you become witnesses to (other) people - 22:78) On the Day of Resurrection the Holy Prophet ﷺ will depose that he had conveyed the commands of Allah Ta’ ala to his Ummah and the Ummah will acknowledge this fact. But when other prophets will make similar depositions, their Ummahs will deny their claims and at that time the Ummah of the Holy Prophet ﷺ will come forward and bear witness to the fact that all the prophets had indeed conveyed the commands of Allah Ta’ ala to their respective Ummahs. This evidence will be challenged on the ground that since the Muslim Ummah did not even exist in those earlier times it carried no weight, to which the Muslims will reply that they learned about these matters from their own Prophet ﷺ ، whose truthfulness and integrity was admitted by all. This is the gist of a hadith which Bukhari and others have related on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Said al-Khudri ؓ .</p><p>فَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ (So establish salah and pay zakah - 22:78) It means that since Allah Ta’ ala has showered on you unlimited benefits, it is your duty also to show your gratitude to Him by striving hard to obey His commands. The two commands relating to prayers and zakah have been specifically mentioned because prayer is the most important among the obligations performed by human body, while zakah is the most important among the commands about wealth, otherwise the idea is that all commands enjoined by Allah Ta’ ala be obeyed and followed.</p><p>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِاللَّـهِ (And hold fast to Allah - 22:78). It means that pious Muslims should place their trust in Allah alone in all their affairs and seek help from none but Him. According to Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ the sense of these words is that pious Muslims should seek Allah's protection from all things which are loathsome in this world and in the Hereafter. Others have interpreted these words to mean that good Muslims should hold fast to the Qur'an and Sunnah, and have quoted the following hadith:</p><p>ترکت فیکم امرین لن تضلّوا ما تمسّکتم بھما، کتاب اللہ و سُنّۃ رسولہ (رواہ مالک فی المؤطاء مرسلاأ مظھری)</p><p>\"I have left behind two things with you and if you hold fast to them you will never go astray: one is the Book of Allah and the second is the Sunnah of His Rasul.\" (Mazhari)</p><p>Al-Hamdulillah</p><p>The Commentary on</p><p>Surah AI-Hajj</p><p>Ends here.</p>"
