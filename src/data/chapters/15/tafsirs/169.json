Here, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Buruj big stars refers to the heavenly bodies.

These winds are mentioned here in the plural form because they give results, unlike the barren wind (Ar-Rih Al-'Aqim, see Adh-Dhariyat 51:41), which is mentioned in the singular and described as barren since it does not produce anything; because results can only be produced when there are two or more things.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And We sent the winds fertilizing.) `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The wind is sent bearing water from the sky, then it fertilizes the clouds until rain begins to generously fall, just as the milk of the pregnant camel flows generously.\" This was also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Qatadah.

These winds are mentioned here in the plural form because they give results, unlike the barren wind (Ar-Rih Al-'Aqim, see Adh-Dhariyat 51:41), which is mentioned in the singular and described as barren since it does not produce anything; because results can only be produced when there are two or more things.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And We sent the winds fertilizing.) `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The wind is sent bearing water from the sky, then it fertilizes the clouds until rain begins to generously fall, just as the milk of the pregnant camel flows generously.\" This was also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Qatadah. Ad-Dahhak said: \"Allah sends it to the clouds and it gets fertilized and becomes full of water.\" `Ubayd bin `Umayr Al-Laythi said: \"Allah sends the wind which stirs up the earth, then Allah sends the wind which raises clouds, then Allah sends the wind which forms clouds, then Allah sends the fertilizing wind which pollinates the trees. Then he recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And We sent the winds fertilizing,)</p><h2>Fresh Water is a Blessing from Allah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقَيْنَاكُمُوهُ</div><p>(and We give it to you to drink,) This means, \"and We send it down to you fresh and sweet, so that you can drink it; if We had wished, We could have made it salty (and undrinkable)\", as Allah points out in another Ayah in Surat Al-Waqi`ah, where He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ الْمَآءَ الَّذِى تَشْرَبُونَ - أَءَنتُمْ أَنزَلْتُمُوهُ مِنَ الْمُزْنِ أَمْ نَحْنُ الْمُنزِلُونَ - لَوْ نَشَآءُ جَعَلْنَـهُ أُجَاجاً فَلَوْلاَ تَشْكُرُونَ </div><p>(Tell Me! The water that you drink, is it you who cause it to come down from the rain clouds, or are We the cause of it coming down If We willed, We verily could make it salty (and undrinkable), why then do you not give thanks (to Allah)) (56:68-70). And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَآءً لَّكُم مَّنْهُ شَرَابٌ وَمِنْهُ شَجَرٌ فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ </div><p>(He it is Who sends water down from the sky; from it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture.) (16:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنْتُمْ لَهُ بِخَـزِنِينَ</div><p>(and it is not you who are the owners of its supply.) The meaning is, \"You are not taking care of it; rather We send it down and take care of it for you, making springs and wells flourish on the earth. \" If Allah so willed, He could make it disappear, but by His mercy He sends it down and makes it fresh and sweet, maintaining the springs, wells, rivers and so on, so that they may drink from it all year long, water their livestock and irrigate their crops.</p><h2>The Power of Allah to initiate and renew Creation</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإنَّا لَنَحْنُ نُحْىِ وَنُمِيتُ</div><p>(And certainly We! We it is Who give life, and cause death,) Here Allah tells us of His power to initiate creation and renew it. He is the One Who brings life to creatures out of nothingness, then He causes them to die, then He will resurrect all of them on the Day when He will gather them together. He also tells us that He will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and then it is to Him that they will return. Then He tells us about His perfect knowledge of them, the first and the last of them. He says</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا الْمُسْتَقْدِمِينَ مِنكُمْ</div><p>(And indeed, We know the first generations of you who had passed away...). Ibn `Abbas said, \"The first generations are all those who have passed away since the time of Adam. The present generations and those who will come afterward refer to those who are alive now and who are yet to come, until the Day of Resurrection.\" Something similar was narrated from `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ash-Sha`bi and others. Ibn Jarir reported from Muhammad bin Abi Ma`shar, from his father, that he heard `Awn bin `Abdullah discussing the following Ayah with Muhammad bin Ka`b:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا الْمُسْتَقْدِمِينَ مِنكُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا الْمُسْتَـْخِرِينَ </div><p>(And indeed, We know the first generations of you who had passed away, and indeed, We know the present generations of you (mankind), and also those who will come afterwards), and it was stated that it refers to the rows for prayer. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"This is not the case.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْنَا الْمُسْتَقْدِمِينَ مِنكُمْ</div><p>(And indeed, We know the first generations of you who had passed away) it refers to those who are dead or have been killed, and;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُسْتَـْخِرِينَ</div><p>(and also those who will come afterwards) meaning those who have yet to be created.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ إِنَّهُ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily your Lord will gather them together. Truly, He is Most Wise, (and) Knowing).\" `Awn bin `Abdullah said, \"May Allah help you and reward you with good.\"</p>"

Once while a Prophet was in his place of worship, the enemy of Allah - meaning Iblis - came and sat between him and the Qiblah (direction of prayer).

Whoever denies even one Messenger, then he has disbelieved in all of the Messengers, thus they are described as rejecting \"the Messengers\". Allah tells us that he (Salih) brought them signs to prove that what he was telling them was true, such as the she-camel which Allah created for them out of a solid rock in response to the supplication of Salih. This she-camel was grazing on their lands, and the people and the camel took water on alternate days that were well-known. When they rebelled and killed it, he said to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَمَتَّعُواْ فِى دَارِكُمْ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ</div><p>(\"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days.

It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious for you, for the believers - he is full of pity, kind and merciful)(9:128). There were some differences among the scholars over the meaning of \"seven of the Mathani\". Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others said that they are the seven long (Surahs), meaning Al-Baqarah, Al- `Imran, An-Nisa', Al-Ma'idah, Al-An`am, Al-A`raf and Yunus. There are texts to this effect reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Sa`id said: \"In them, Allah explains the obligations, the Hudud (legal limits), stories and rulings.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"He explains the parables, stories and lessons.\" The second opinion is that they (the seven of the Mathani) are Al-Fatihah, which is composed of seven Ayat.

Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others said that they are the seven long (Surahs), meaning Al-Baqarah, Al- `Imran, An-Nisa', Al-Ma'idah, Al-An`am, Al-A`raf and Yunus. There are texts to this effect reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Sa`id said: \"In them, Allah explains the obligations, the Hudud (legal limits), stories and rulings.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"He explains the parables, stories and lessons.\" The second opinion is that they (the seven of the Mathani) are Al-Fatihah, which is composed of seven Ayat. This was reported from `Ali, `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas. Ibn `Abbas said: \"The Bismillah, is completing seven Ayah, which Allah has given exclusively to you (Muslims).\" This is also the opinion of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin `Umayr, Ibn Abi Mulaykah, Shahr bin Hawshab, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Mujahid.

One of the arrows got caught in his garment and scratched his foot. It was an insignificant wound, but now it opened again and he died of it. Al-`As bin Wa'il passed by, and he pointed to the instep of his foot. He (Al-`As) set off on his donkey, heading for At-Ta'if.

Put your trust in Him, for He will suffice you and will support you against them. Keep yourself busy with remembering Allah, praising Him, glorifying Him, and worshipping Him (which means Salah, or prayer)' Hence Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُنْ مِّنَ السَّـجِدِينَ </div><p>(So glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him)) Imam Ahmad reported from Nu`aym bin Hammar that he heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ لَا تَعْجَزْ عَنْ أَرْبَعِ رَكَعَاتٍ مِنْ أَوَّلِ النَّهَارِ أَكْفِكَ آخِرَه»</div><p>(Allah said, \"O son of Adam!

Al-Bukhari said: \"Salim said, `(This means) death.\"' This Salim is Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar. Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin `Abdullah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ </div><p>(And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, \"Death.\" It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-`Ala'- one of the women of the Ansar - that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon `Uthman bin Maz`un after he had died, Umm Al-`Ala' said, \"May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Sa`ib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you.\" The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</div><p>(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah!

It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from `Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب»</div><p>(Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.) From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret Yaqin (the certainty) as Ma`rifah (\"spiritual knowing\") as some of the Sufis do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of Ma`rifah, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets - peace be upon them - and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by Yaqin here is death, as we have stated above. To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hijr. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.</p>"

Al-Bukhari said: \"Salim said, `(This means) death.\"' This Salim is Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar. Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin `Abdullah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ </div><p>(And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, \"Death.\" It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-`Ala'- one of the women of the Ansar - that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon `Uthman bin Maz`un after he had died, Umm Al-`Ala' said, \"May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Sa`ib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you.\" The Messenger of Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</div><p>(How do you know that Allah has honored him) I said, \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</div><p>(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.) This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ </div><p>(And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability. It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from `Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب»</div><p>(Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.) From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret Yaqin (the certainty) as Ma`rifah (\"spiritual knowing\") as some of the Sufis do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of Ma`rifah, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets - peace be upon them - and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by Yaqin here is death, as we have stated above. To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hijr. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.</p>"
