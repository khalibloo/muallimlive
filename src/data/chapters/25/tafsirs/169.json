This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَـبَ وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا قَيِّماً لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْسًا شَدِيدًا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ الصَّـلِحَاتِ</div><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant the Book, and has not placed therein any crookedness. (He has made it) straight to give warning of a severe punishment from Him, and to give glad tidings to the believers, who do righteous deeds...) 18:1-2 Here Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَبَارَكَ</div><p>(Blessed be He.) The verbal form used here implies an ongoing, permanent, eternal blessing.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ</div><p>(Who sent down the criterion) The verb Nazzala is a form which implies something done a great deal and often. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَـبِ الَّذِى أَنَزلَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(And the Book which He (Nazzala) sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He (Anzala) sent down to those before (him)) (4:136). Each of the previous Books was sent down at one time, but the Qur'an was revealed gradually, in stages, Ayat after Ayat, rulings after rulings, Surahs after Surahs. This is more eloquent and indicative of greater care for the one to whom it is revealed, as Allah says later in this Surah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الْقُرْءَانُ جُمْلَةً وَحِدَةً كَذَلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ تَرْتِيلاً - وَلاَ يَأْتُونَكَ بِمَثَلٍ إِلاَّ جِئْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ وَأَحْسَنَ تَفْسِيراً </div><p>(And those who disbelieve say: \"Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once\" Thus, that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages. And no example or similitude do they bring, but We reveal to you the truth, and the better explanation thereof.) (25:32-33) This Surah was named Al-Furqan, because it is the criterion that decides between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, right and wrong, lawful and unlawful.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى عَبْدِهِ</div><p>(to His servant) This description is one of praise and commendation, because here Allah is connecting him to Himself, describing him as His servant. Allah also described him in this manner when referring to the noblest of events, the Night of the Isra', as He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً</div><p>(Glorified be He Who took His servant for a journey by night) (17:1). Allah also described him in this way when He described how he stood and called to Him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُ لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً </div><p>(And when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they (the Jinn) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet's recitation).) (72:19) This description is also used here when Allah describes how the Book is revealed to him and how the angel comes down to him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً </div><p>(Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to all nations.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً</div><p>(that he may be a warner to all nations.) means, he alone has been blessed with this great, detailed, clear Book which,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ </div><p>(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah).) (41:42) The One Who made it the mighty criterion, singled him out to convey it to those who seek the shade of trees and to those who live on the land (i.e., to all of mankind, nomad and settled alike), as the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الْأَحْمَرِ وَالْأَسْوَد»</div><p>(I have been sent to the red and the black.) And he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي»</div><p>(I have been given five things which no Prophet before me was given. ) Among them he mentioned:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»</div><p>(Before me a Prophet was sent only to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.) And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</div><p>(Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah...\") (7:158), meaning, the One Who has sent me is the Sovereign of the heaven and the earth, who merely says to a thing \"Be!\" and it is. He is the one who gives life and causes death. Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِى المُلْكِ</div><p>(He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion.) Allah states that He is above having any offspring or partner. Then He tells us:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍفَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</div><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.) meaning, everything apart from Him is created and subject to Him. He is the Creator, Lord, Master and God of all things, and everything is subject to His dominion, control and power.</p>"

Because this idea is so foolish and is so patently false, everyone knows that it is not true. It is known through Mutawatir reports and is a common fact that Muhammad the Messenger of Allah never learned to read or write, either at the beginning or the end of his life. He grew up among them for approximately forty years, from the time he was born until the time when his mission began. They knew all about him, and about his honest and sound character and how he would never lie or do anything immoral or bad. They even used to call him Al-Amin (the Trustworthy One) from a young age, until his mission began, because they saw how truthful and honest he was. When Allah honored him with that which He honored him, they declared their enmity towards him and came up with all these accusations which any reasonable person would know he was innocent of. They were not sure what to accuse him of. Sometimes they said that he was a sorcerer, at other times they would say he was a poet, or crazy, or a liar. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً </div><p>(See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.) (17:48) In response to their stubbornness, Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth\".) meaning, He has revealed the Qur'an which includes true information about the earlier and later generations, information which concurs with the realities of the past and future.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ</div><p>(Who knows the secret) means, Allah is the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on the earth; He knows their secrets just as He knows what is visible therein.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</div><p>(Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an invitation to them to repent and turn back to Allah, telling them that His mercy is vast and His patience is immense. Whoever repents to Him, He accepts his repentance. Despite all their lies, immorality, falsehood, disbelief and stubbornness, and saying what they said about the Messenger and the Qur'an, He still invites them to repent and give up their sin, and to come to Islam and true guidance. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَـلِثُ ثَلَـثَةٍ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُواْ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ - أَفَلاَ يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three.\" But there is no god but One God. And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them. Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (5:73-74)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُواْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُواْ فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ </div><p>(Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women, and then do not turn in repentance, then they will have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning Fire.)

Despite all their lies, immorality, falsehood, disbelief and stubbornness, and saying what they said about the Messenger and the Qur'an, He still invites them to repent and give up their sin, and to come to Islam and true guidance. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَـلِثُ ثَلَـثَةٍ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُواْ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ - أَفَلاَ يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three.\" But there is no god but One God.

      "text": "<h2>What the Disbelievers said about the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah tells us about the foolishness of the disbelievers' ignorant minds, when they said about the Qur'an:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ</div><p>(This is nothing but a lie), meaning an untruth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">افْتَرَاهُ</div><p>(that he has invented,) meaning the Prophet .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَعَانَهُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ ءَاخَرُونَ</div><p>(and others have helped him in it.) means, he asked other people to help him compile it. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدْ جَآءُوا ظُلْماً وَزُوراً</div><p>(In fact, they have produced an unjust wrong and a lie.) meaning, they are the ones who are telling a lie, and they know that it is false, for their own souls know that what they are claiming is not true.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ اكْتَتَبَهَا</div><p>(And they say: \"Tales of the ancients which he has written down...\") meaning, the ancients wrote them down, and he has copied it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهِىَ تُمْلَى عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(and they are dictated to him) means, they are read or recited to him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً</div><p>(morning and afternoon. ) at the beginning and end of the day. Because this idea is so foolish and is so patently false, everyone knows that it is not true. It is known through Mutawatir reports and is a common fact that Muhammad the Messenger of Allah never learned to read or write, either at the beginning or the end of his life. He grew up among them for approximately forty years, from the time he was born until the time when his mission began. They knew all about him, and about his honest and sound character and how he would never lie or do anything immoral or bad. They even used to call him Al-Amin (the Trustworthy One) from a young age, until his mission began, because they saw how truthful and honest he was. When Allah honored him with that which He honored him, they declared their enmity towards him and came up with all these accusations which any reasonable person would know he was innocent of. They were not sure what to accuse him of. Sometimes they said that he was a sorcerer, at other times they would say he was a poet, or crazy, or a liar. So Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً </div><p>(See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.) (17:48) In response to their stubbornness, Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth\".) meaning, He has revealed the Qur'an which includes true information about the earlier and later generations, information which concurs with the realities of the past and future.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ</div><p>(Who knows the secret) means, Allah is the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on the earth; He knows their secrets just as He knows what is visible therein.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</div><p>(Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)

Never did I say to them aught except what You did command me to say.\") (5:116-117) Describing how those who were worshipped will respond on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَكَ مَا كَانَ يَنبَغِى لَنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ</div><p>(They will say: \"Glorified be You!

This meaning is close to the first.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن مَّتَّعْتَهُمْ وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</div><p>(but You gave them and their fathers comfort) means, `You made such a long period of time pass that they forgot the Reminder, i.e., they forgot what had been sent down to them through the Messengers, calling them to worship You alone with no partner or associate.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً بُوراً</div><p>(and became a lost people.)

      "text": "<h2>The Stubbornness of the Disbelievers</h2><p>Allah describes how stubborn the disbelievers were in their disbelief when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا</div><p>(Why are not the angels sent down to us,) meaning, `so that we may see them with our own eyes and they may tell us that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.'

And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى</div><p>(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...)

And they will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") means, when they do see the angels, it will not be a good day for them, for on that day there will be no good news for them. This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, \"Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke.\" It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs...\") (8:50)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands.) that is, to beat them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</div><p>((saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject His Ayat with disrespect!\") (6: 93) Hence in this Ayah Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals) This is in contrast to the state of the believers when death approaches them, for they are given glad tidings of joy and delight. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ </div><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah,\" and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the good news of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have what your souls desire, and therein you shall have what you ask for. Entertainment from, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): \"Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry.\" Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news) vrefers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(And they (angels) will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") The angels will say to the disbelievers: `success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition, hence the word is used in the phrase \"Hajara Al-Qadi `Ala Fulan\" (or, \"The judge prohibited so and so.\") when he forbids him to dispose of his wealth in cases of bankruptcy, folly, being underage, etc. The name of Al-Hijr (the low semicircular wall near the Ka`bah) is also derived from this root, because it prevents people from Tawaf inside it, since they have to go behind it. The mind is also called Al-Hijr, because it prevents a person from indulging in things that do not befit him. In conclusion, the pronoun in the phrase.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ</div><p>(And they will say) refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels) means, they will seek refuge from the angels. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(\"Hijran Mahjura.\") Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did,) This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari`ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً </div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Abu Ishaq, from Al-Harith that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</div><p>(and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) \"The rays of the sun when they pass through a small aperture.\" A similar view was also narrated through a different chain of narrators from `Ali, and something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This refers to the rays coming through a small window, and if anyone tries to grasp them, he cannot.\" Abu Al-Ahwas narrated from Abu Ishaq from Al-Harith that `Ali said: \"Haba' refers to the dust raised by animals. \" A similar view was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak, and this was also said by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</div><p>(scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) Qatadah said: \"Have you not seen dry trees when they are blown by the wind This refers to those leaves.\" It was narrated that Ya`la bin `Ubayd said: \"Ashes or dust when it is stirred up by the wind.\" In conclusion, all of these views are pointing out that the deeds of the disbelievers will be like some worthless scattered thing, and will be of no avail to them whatsoever. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ</div><p>(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously) (14:18).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى</div><p>(O you who believe!

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً </div><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, in return for what they have done of acceptable deeds, they will attain what they will attain and reach the status they will reach, in contrast to the people of Hell, who will not have even one deed to their credit that would qualify them to enter Paradise and be saved from the Fire. Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Allah will finish the Judgement halfway through the Day, and the people of Paradise will take their mid day rest in Paradise and the people of Hell in Hell.

And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى</div><p>(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...)

And they will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") means, when they do see the angels, it will not be a good day for them, for on that day there will be no good news for them. This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, \"Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke.\" It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs...\") (8:50)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands.) that is, to beat them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</div><p>((saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject His Ayat with disrespect!\") (6: 93) Hence in this Ayah Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals) This is in contrast to the state of the believers when death approaches them, for they are given glad tidings of joy and delight. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ </div><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah,\" and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the good news of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have what your souls desire, and therein you shall have what you ask for. Entertainment from, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): \"Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry.\" Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news) vrefers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(And they (angels) will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") The angels will say to the disbelievers: `success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition, hence the word is used in the phrase \"Hajara Al-Qadi `Ala Fulan\" (or, \"The judge prohibited so and so.\") when he forbids him to dispose of his wealth in cases of bankruptcy, folly, being underage, etc. The name of Al-Hijr (the low semicircular wall near the Ka`bah) is also derived from this root, because it prevents people from Tawaf inside it, since they have to go behind it. The mind is also called Al-Hijr, because it prevents a person from indulging in things that do not befit him. In conclusion, the pronoun in the phrase.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ</div><p>(And they will say) refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels) means, they will seek refuge from the angels. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(\"Hijran Mahjura.\") Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did,) This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari`ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted.

Therein you shall have what your souls desire, and therein you shall have what you ask for. Entertainment from, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): \"Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry.\" Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news) vrefers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(And they (angels) will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") The angels will say to the disbelievers: `success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition, hence the word is used in the phrase \"Hajara Al-Qadi `Ala Fulan\" (or, \"The judge prohibited so and so.\") when he forbids him to dispose of his wealth in cases of bankruptcy, folly, being underage, etc. The name of Al-Hijr (the low semicircular wall near the Ka`bah) is also derived from this root, because it prevents people from Tawaf inside it, since they have to go behind it. The mind is also called Al-Hijr, because it prevents a person from indulging in things that do not befit him. In conclusion, the pronoun in the phrase.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ</div><p>(And they will say) refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ</div><p>(On the Day they will see the angels) means, they will seek refuge from the angels. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</div><p>(\"Hijran Mahjura.\") Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did,) This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari`ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً </div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Abu Ishaq, from Al-Harith that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</div><p>(and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) \"The rays of the sun when they pass through a small aperture.\" A similar view was also narrated through a different chain of narrators from `Ali, and something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This refers to the rays coming through a small window, and if anyone tries to grasp them, he cannot.\" Abu Al-Ahwas narrated from Abu Ishaq from Al-Harith that `Ali said: \"Haba' refers to the dust raised by animals. \" A similar view was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak, and this was also said by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</div><p>(scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) Qatadah said: \"Have you not seen dry trees when they are blown by the wind This refers to those leaves.\" It was narrated that Ya`la bin `Ubayd said: \"Ashes or dust when it is stirred up by the wind.\" In conclusion, all of these views are pointing out that the deeds of the disbelievers will be like some worthless scattered thing, and will be of no avail to them whatsoever. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ</div><p>(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously) (14:18).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى</div><p>(O you who believe!

Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Allah will finish the Judgement halfway through the Day, and the people of Paradise will take their mid day rest in Paradise and the people of Hell in Hell.

This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, \"Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke.\" It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs...\") (8:50)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands.) that is, to beat them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</div><p>((saying): \"Deliver your souls!

Would that I had never taken so-and-so as an intimate friend!) meaning, the one among the propagators of misguidance who diverted him from true guidance and led him to follow the path of misguidance, whether this refers to Umayyah bin Khalaf or his brother Ubayy bin Khalaf, or to someone else.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ أَضَلَّنِى عَنِ الذِّكْرِ</div><p>(He indeed led me astray from the Reminder) means the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَنِى</div><p>(after it had come to me.) means, after it had reached me.

As for the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, Ibn Jurayj narrated from Ibn `Abbas about the Dwellers of Ar-Rass that they were the people of one of the villages of Thamud.

(23:42) Some defined a generation as being 120 years, or it was said that a generation was one hundred years, or eighty, or forty, etc. The most correct view is that a generation refers to nations who are one another's contemporaries, living at the same time. When they go and others succeed them, this is another generation, as it was recorded in the Two Sahihs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ،ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best of generations is my generation, then the one that follows it, then the one that follows that.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السَّوْءِ</div><p>(And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained the evil rain.) refers to the town of the people of Lut, which was called Sodom, and the way in which Allah dealt with it, when He destroyed it by turning it upside down and by sending upon it the rain of stones of baked clay, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ </div><p>(And We rained on them a rain.

      "text": "<h2>Frightening the Idolators of Quraysh</h2><p>Allah threatens the idolators who denied and opposed His Messenger Muhammad and He warns them of the punishment and painful torment He sent upon the previous nations who rejected their Messengers. Allah begins by mentioning Musa, upon him be peace, whom He sent along with his brother Harun as a helper -- i.e., as another Prophet who helped and supported him -- but Fir`awn and his chiefs denied them both:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا</div><p>(Allah destroyed them completely, and similar (awaits) the disbelievers) (47:10). And when the people of Nuh denied him, Allah destroyed them likewise, for whoever denies one Messenger denies all the Messengers, because there is no difference between one Messenger and another. If it had so happened that Allah had sent all His Messengers to them, they would have denied them all. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ الرُّسُلَ</div><p>(And Nuh's people, when they denied the Messengers,) although Allah sent only Nuh to them, and he stayed among them for 950 years, calling them to Allah and warning them of His punishment,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ</div><p>(And none believed with him, except a few) (11:40). For this reason Allah drowned them all and left no one among the sons of Adam alive on earth apart from those who boarded the boat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ ءَايَةً</div><p>(and We made them a sign for mankind.) meaning a lesson to be learned. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ </div><p>(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear may understand it) (69:11-12), which means: `We left for you ships that you ride upon to travel across the depths of the seas, so that you may remember the blessing of Allah towards you when He saved you from drowning, and made you the descendants of those who believed in Allah and followed His commandments.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَأَصْحَـبَ الرَّسِّ</div><p>(And (also) `Ad and Thamud, and the Dwellers of Ar-Rass,) We have already discussed their story, which is referred to in more than one Surah, such as Surat Al-A`raf, and there is no need to repeat it here. As for the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, Ibn Jurayj narrated from Ibn `Abbas about the Dwellers of Ar-Rass that they were the people of one of the villages of Thamud. Ath-Thawri narrated from Abu Bukayr from `Ikrimah that Ar-Rass was a well where they buried (Rassu) their Prophet.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُرُوناً بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ كَثِيراً</div><p>(and many generations in between. ) means nations, many more than have been mentioned here, whom We destroyed. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلاًّ ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ</div><p>(And for each We put forward examples,) meaning, `We showed them the proof and gave them clear evidence,' as Qatadah said, \"They had no excuse.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلاًّ تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيراً</div><p>(and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin.) means, `We destroyed them completely.' This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ</div><p>(And how many generations (Qurun) have We destroyed after Nuh!) (17:17). \"Generations\" (Qurun) here refers to nations among mankind. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً ءَاخَرِينَ </div><p>(Then, after them, We created other generations (Qurun).) (23:42) Some defined a generation as being 120 years, or it was said that a generation was one hundred years, or eighty, or forty, etc. The most correct view is that a generation refers to nations who are one another's contemporaries, living at the same time. When they go and others succeed them, this is another generation, as it was recorded in the Two Sahihs:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ،ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</div><p>(The best of generations is my generation, then the one that follows it, then the one that follows that.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السَّوْءِ</div><p>(And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained the evil rain.) refers to the town of the people of Lut, which was called Sodom, and the way in which Allah dealt with it, when He destroyed it by turning it upside down and by sending upon it the rain of stones of baked clay, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ </div><p>(And We rained on them a rain. And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned!) (26:176),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ - وَبِالَّيْلِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Verily, you pass by them in the morning. And at night; will you not then reflect) (37:137-138),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٍ مُّقِيمٍ </div><p>(And verily, they were right on the highroad.) (15:76),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(They are both on an open highway, plain to see) (15:79).

They do this with no evidence or proof; the only thing that led them to do this was their own whims and desires. So they take these idols as protectors and fight for their sake, and they oppose Allah and His Messenger and the believers for their sake. Similarly Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</div><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ - لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مٌّحْضَرُونَ </div><p>(And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped.

Allah is the One in Whom you should put your trust and to Whom you should turn for refuge, He will be sufficient for you and will be your helper and supporter, and will cause you to prevail.

What he says is true, and he is the leader whose decision counts; when there is a dispute, people are obliged to refer to him, and whatever is in accordance with his words and deeds is right, and whatever goes against them should be rejected no matter who says or does it. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ</div><p>((And) if you differ in anything among yourselves...)

      "text": "<h2>The Ignorance of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah tells us how ignorant the idolators are; instead of worshipping Allah, they worship idols which do not possess the power either to harm or benefit. They do this with no evidence or proof; the only thing that led them to do this was their own whims and desires. So they take these idols as protectors and fight for their sake, and they oppose Allah and His Messenger and the believers for their sake. Similarly Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</div><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ - لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مٌّحْضَرُونَ </div><p>(And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped. They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them.) (36:74-75) meaning, the gods which they worshipped instead of Allah cannot help them. These ignorant people are troops for the idols and are ready to fight for their sake and protect their sanctuaries, but in the end the victory will be for Allah and His Messenger and the believers, in this world and the Hereafter.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</div><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord. ) Mujahid said: \"He supports and helps the Shaytan in disobedience towards Allah.</p><h2>The Messenger brings Glad Tidings and Warnings</h2><p>Then Allah tells His Messenger:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً </div><p>(And We have sent you only as a bearer of good news and a warner.) meaning, a bringer of good news to the believers, a warner to the disbelievers; bringing good news of Paradise to those who obey Allah, and bringing warnings of a dreadful punishment for those who go against the commandments of Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ مَآ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ</div><p>(Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this...\") `for conveying this message and this warning, I do not ask for any reward from your wealth; I am only doing this for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِمَن شَآءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ </div><p>(To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight) (81:28).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ أَن يَتَّخِذَ إِلَى رَبِّهِ سَبِيلاً</div><p>(save that whosoever wills, may take a path to his Lord.) means, a way and a methodology to be followed.</p><p>The Command to the Messenger to put his Trust in Allah, and someof His Qualities</p><p>Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْحَىِّ الَّذِى لاَ يَمُوتُ</div><p>(And put your trust in the Ever Living One Who dies not,) meaning, in all your affairs, put your trust in Allah, the Ever-Living Who never dies, the One Who</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(is the First and the Last, the Most High and the Most Near. And He is the All-Knower of everything) (57:3). The Eternal, Ever-Lasting, Ever-Living, Self-Sufficient One, the Lord and Sovereign of all things, the One to Whom you should always turn. Allah is the One in Whom you should put your trust and to Whom you should turn for refuge, He will be sufficient for you and will be your helper and supporter, and will cause you to prevail. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(O Messenger!

He asked, \"Then what\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»</div><p>(That you kill your child for fear that he may eat with you.) He said, \"Then what\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تُزَانِي حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»</div><p>(That you commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) `Abdullah said, \"Then Allah revealed, confirming that:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</div><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah....)\" This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It was narrated that Sa`id bin Jubayr heard Ibn `Abbas saying that some of the people of Shirk killed a great deal and committed Zina a great deal, then they came to Muhammad and said: \"What you are saying and calling people to is good, if only you would tell us that there is a way to expiate for what we have done.\" Then the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</div><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah...) was revealed, as was the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ</div><p>(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves!\") (39:53).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَاماً</div><p>(and whoever does this shall receive Athama.) It was recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: \"Athama is a valley in Hell.\" `Ikrimah also said that Athama refers to valleys in Hell in which those who commit unlawful sexual acts will be punished. This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid. As-Suddi said that Athama referred to punishment, which is closer to the apparent meaning of the Ayah. This interpretation makes it interchangeable with what comes next, the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُضَـعَفْ لَهُ الْعَذَابُ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ</div><p>(The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection,) i.e., repetitive and intensified.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَخْلُدْ فِيهِ مُهَاناً</div><p>(and he will abide therein in disgrace;) scorned and humiliated.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلاً صَـلِحاً</div><p>(Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds;) means, those who do these evil deeds will be punished in the manner described,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ</div><p>(Except those who repent), that is; those who repent in this world to Allah from all of those deeds, for then Allah will accept their repentance. This is evidence that the repentance of the murderer is acceptable, and there is no contradiction between this and the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa':</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِناً مُّتَعَمِّداً</div><p>(And whoever kills a believer intentionally) (4:93), because even though this was revealed in Al-Madinah, the meaning is general, and it could be interpreted to refer to one who does not repent, because this Ayah states that forgiveness is only for those who repent. Moreover Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives except that to whom He wills) (4:48). And in the authentic Sunnah, it is reported from the Messenger of Allah that the repentance of a murderer is acceptable, as was stated in the story of the person who killed one hundred men and then repented, and Allah accepted his repentance, and other Hadiths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُوْلَـئِكَ يُبَدِّلُ اللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ حَسَنَـتٍ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</div><p>(for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)

A man will be brought and it will be said, \"Take away his major sins and ask him about his minor sins.\" So it will be said to him: \"On such and such a day, you did such and such, and on such and such a day, you did such and such.\" He will say, \"Yes, and he will not be able to deny anything.\" Then it will be said to him: \"For every evil deed you now have one good merit.\" He will say: \"O Lord, I did things that I do not see here.\") He (Abu Dharr) said: \"And the Messenger of Allah smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen.\" Muslim recorded it. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Jabir heard Makhul say, \"A very old man with sunken eyes came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, a man betrayed others and did immoral deeds, and there was no evil deed which he did not do. If (his sins) were to be distributed among the whole of mankind, they would all be doomed.

They do not bear witness to falsehood, including lies, immorality, disbelief, foul speech and false words. `Amr bin Qays said, this refers to gatherings of sexual immorality. It was said that the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ</div><p>(And those who do not bear witness to falsehood,) refers to giving false testimony, which means lying deliberately to someone else. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Bakrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah said three times:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»</div><p>(Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins) We said, \"Of course, O Messenger of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْن»</div><p>(Associating others in worship with Allah and disobeying one's parents.) He was lying down, then he sat up and added:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ، أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور»</div><p>(Beware false speech, and bearing witness to falsehood.) and he kept repeating it until we thought, would that he would stop.\" From the context it seems that what is meant by those who do not bear witness to falsehood is those who do not attend it or are not present when it happens. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّواْ كِراماً</div><p>(and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.) They do not attend where falsehood occurs, and if it so happens that they pass by it, they do not let it contaminate them in the slightest. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَرُّواْ كِراماً</div><p>(they pass by it with dignity.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً </div><p>(And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.) This is also a characteristic of the believers,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</div><p>(Those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord.) (8:2) Unlike the disbelievers. When they hear the Words of Allah, they are not affected by them or moved to change their ways. They persist in their disbelief, wrongdoing, ignorance and misguidance, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</div><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add doubt to their doubt) (9:124-125).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً</div><p>(fall not deaf and blind thereat.) means, unlike the disbelievers who, when they hear the Ayat of Allah, are not moved by them, but continue as they are, as if they did not hear them but are deaf and blind. His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّـتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ</div><p>(And those who say: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes...\") means those who ask Allah to bring forth from their loins offspring who will obey Him and worship Him and not associate anything in worship with Him. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means (offspring) who will strive to obey Allah and bring them joy in this world and the Hereafter.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Nufayr said: \"We sat with Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad one day, and a man passed by and said, \"How blessed are these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allah ! Would that we had seen what you saw and witnessed what you witnessed.\" Al-Miqdad got angry, and I was surprised, because the man had not said anything but good. Then he turned to him and said, \"What makes a man wish to be present when Allah had caused him to be absent, and he does not know how he would have behaved if he had been there By Allah, there are people who saw the Messenger of Allah , and Allah will throw them on their faces in Hell because they did not accept him or believe in him. Are you not grateful that Allah brought you forth from your mothers' wombs believing in your Lord and in what your Prophet brought, and that the test went to others and not to you Allah sent His Prophet during the most difficult time that any Prophet was ever sent, after a long period of ignorance, when the people could see no better religion than the worship of idols, and he brought the Criterion which distinguishes truth from falsehood and which would separate a father from his son. A man would realize that his father, son or brother was a disbeliever, and since Allah had opened his heart to Faith, he knew that if his relative died he would go to Hell, so he could not rest knowing that his loved one was in the Fire. This is what Allah referred to in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّـتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ</div><p>(And those who say: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes...\") Its chain of narrators is Sahih, although they did not report it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاجْعَلْنَا لِلْمُتَّقِينَ إِمَاماً</div><p>(and make us leaders of those who have Taqwa.) Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Rabi` bin Anas said: \"Leaders who would be taken as examples in good.\" Others said: \"Guides who would call others to goodness.\" They wanted their worship to be connected to the worship of their children and offspring, and their guidance to go beyond themselves and benefit others. This would be more rewarding and a better end, as it was recorded in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّااِمنْ ثَلَاثٍ: وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَة»</div><p>(When a son of Adam dies, his deeds cease apart from three: a righteous child who will pray for him, knowledge from which others may benefit after him, or ongoing charity.)</p>"
