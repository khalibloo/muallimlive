She was complaining to Allah about what her husband had done to her, and Allah was listening to your exchange of words; nothing is hidden from Him, indeed, He is The Hearing of the speech of His servants and The Seeing of their actions; none of them are hidden from Him."

Do you not see the Jews who used to secretly whisper when they would see a believer, then Allah prohibited them from such whispering, but they would return to committing exactly that which Allah prohibited them from: secretly discussing sin among themselves i.e. backbiting the believers, inciting people against them, and disobedience to the Messenger. O Messenger! When they come to they greet you with a greeting Allah has not taught you to greet with, i.e. by saying: ‘As-sāmu ‘alayk’ meaning ‘death be upon you’, and they say, rejecting the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say? Because if he was truthful in his claim that he is a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we say about him!” Hell is enough of a punishment for them for what they say; they will definitely suffer its heat. What an evil outcome they will face!"

You will not find a people believing in Allah and in the Day of Judgement, who love and befriend those who regard Allah and His Messenger as enemies, even though these enemies of Allah and His messengers happen to be their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribe members they affiliate themselves to. This is because faith prevents them from befriending the enemies of Allah and His Messenger, and because the connection of faith is greater than all connections, so it is to be given priority at times of conflict. Those who do not befriend the enemies of Allah and His Messenger - even if they are their own relatives - are the ones in whose hearts Allah has established faith such that they do not waver, and has strengthened with His proof and light. He will also enter them on the Day of Judgement into everlasting gardens, under the palaces and trees of which rivers flow, and in which they shall live forever, without its luxuries ever finishing or them ever becoming extinct. Allah is pleased with them to a degree that He will never be displeased with them afterwards, and they are also pleased with Him because of Him having given them favours which will never finish, one of which is the ability to see Him may He be glorified. They are the party of Allah that fulfils whatever He commands and refrain from the things He does not allow. Know well that indeed, the party of Allah are the ones who will succeed by achieving their objective and remaining safe from their fears in the world and the afterlife."
