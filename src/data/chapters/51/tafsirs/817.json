This expansion is proof of the fact that a Creator has created it, because this expansion means that it was initially in a contracted condition. According to the known laws governing matter, all the parts of the initial cosmic ball were attracted inwards. Then there was an explosion—the Big Bang—after which all matter started moving outwards. In view of this law, their movement towards the outside (or the Big Bang) could not have taken place without some external intervention. And once external intervention has been accepted, acceptance of God necessarily follows.</p>"

But, the case of human beings is different. Human beings were not created to fulfill any administrative or other need of God. The sole purpose of their creation was their devotion and servitude (‘ibadah) to God. This implies bowing down without any reservation before God completely and dedicating oneself entirely to Him. The substance of this devotion is deep inner realisation of God (ma‘rifah) (Tafsir ibn Kathir). In other words, it is required of man that God should be a discovery for him. He should recognise God without seeing him. This is essential to ma‘rifah. The shape which the life of a man takes as a result of this ma‘rifah is one of devotion and subservience.</p>"
