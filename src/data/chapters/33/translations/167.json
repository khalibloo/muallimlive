But when fear comes, you will see them looking towards you, rolling their eyes, like the one who gets faint because of death. Then once fear is gone, they assail you with sharp tongues, in greed for the good (i.e. the wealth acquired as spopils).(4) These people did not accept faith (in real terms), therefore Allah has nullified their acts.(5) And all this is so easy for Allah.  (4).\tThis verse has unveiled cowardice of the hypocrites on the one hand, and their greed for wealth on the other. The sense is that they are so coward that when an attack from the enemy is apprehended, they are frightened like a person who becomes faint in fear of death. But when the enemy is driven away by the Muslims, and the spoils of war are distributed, they come forward assailing the Muslims with their sharp tongues and claiming that the victory is achieved with their help, and therefore they deserve a share in the spoils.  (5).\tIt means that virtuous acts deserve reward in the Hereafter only when they are accompanied by true faith in Allah, and since it has become evident that these hypocrites do not have true faith, even their virtuous acts will not be of any use to them in the Hereafter and will remain null and void."

But at the time of the battle of Ahzab, they violated the terms of the treaty and supported the coalition forces. Even earlier, they had been constantly conspiring against the Muslims to an intolerable extent. After the battle of Ahzab was over, the Holy Prophet ﷺ besieged the fortress of Banu qurayzah, and finally, they had to surrender, and most of their men were killed, and the women and children were made captives. This event has been referred to in these verses. At the same time, Allah Ta’ ala has given a good news to the Muslims that they would conquer some other lands which they had not entered before. The words, \"and a land you have not trodden\" refer to such future victories, especially to the conquest of Khyber that followed within a few years after the battle of Ahzab."
