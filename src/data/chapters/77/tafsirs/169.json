It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels.

It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ</div><p>(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord.

This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ </div><p>(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths.

If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.</p><h2>A Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ </div><p>(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ </div><p>(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ </div><p>(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ </div><p>(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ </div><p>(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain.

(18:47) Then He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ </div><p>(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ</div><p>(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُقِّتَتْ</div><p>(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُقِّتَتْ</div><p>(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.)

And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ </div><p>(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers.

(77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah .

It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ</div><p>(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً </div><p>(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ </div><p>(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil.

(77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah . He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>Allah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً </div><p>(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ</div><p>(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً </div><p>(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ </div><p>(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil.

(77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah .

It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ</div><p>(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ</div><p>(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً </div><p>(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ </div><p>(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed.

On the Day of Judgement it will be said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انطَلِقُواْ إِلَى مَا كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ - انطَلِقُواْ إِلَى ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَـثِ شُعَبٍ </div><p>(Depart you to that which you used to deny!

So due to its severity and strength, it will have three columns.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ ظَلِيلٍ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِنَ اللَّهَبِ </div><p>(Neither shady nor of any use against the fierce flame of the Fire.) meaning, shade of the smoke that comes from the flame -- which itself will not have a shade, nor will it benefit against the flame. This means it will not protect them from the heat of the flame. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ </div><p>(Verily, it throws sparks as Al-Qasr,) meaning, its sparks will shoot out from its flame like huge castles. Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Like forts.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik who reported from Zayd bin Aslam and others said, \"This means the trunk of trees.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ </div><p>(As if they were Sufr camels.) means, black camels. This is the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Jarir favored this view. Ibn `Abbas Mujahid, and Sa`id bin Jubayr said about,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ</div><p>(Sufr camels.) \"Meaning ropes of ships.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهَا تَرْمِى بِشَرَرٍ كَالْقَصْرِ </div><p>(Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks as Al-Qasr.) Imam Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said: \"We were directed to the timber a length of three cubits or more in order to use it for construction of buildings. We used to call it Al-Qasr.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُ جِمَـلَةٌ صُفْرٌ </div><p>(As if they were Sufr camels.) These (Jimalat) are ropes of ships that are bundled until they resemble the intestines of men.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(Woe that Day to the deniers!)</p><h2>The Inability of the Criminals to speak, make Excuses, or step forward on the Day of Judgement</h2><p>Then Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا يَوْمُ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ </div><p>(That will be a Day when they shall not speak,) meaning, they will not speak.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُؤْذَنُ لَهُمْ فَيَعْتَذِرُونَ </div><p>(And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.) meaning, they will not be able to speak, nor will they be granted permission to speak so that they can make excuses. Rather, the proof will be established against them, and they will be called upon to speak about the wrong that they did, but they will not be able to say anything. The courts of the Day of Judgement will occur in stages. Sometimes the Lord informs of this stage and sometimes He informs of that stage. This is to show the terrors and calamities of that Day. Thus, after all the details of this discussion, He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ </div><p>(Woe that Day to the deniers!)
