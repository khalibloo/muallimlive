Hence, the meaning of the verse is that except for Allah Ta’ ala everything is mortal and will get destroyed and will vanish. Some commentators have taken the phrase' His Face' to mean the good deeds performed by human beings exclusively for Allah Ta’ ala. In that case the meaning of the verse would be that those actions which are performed exclusively for Allah Ta’ ala will not be destroyed, while all other things will perish.</p><p>اَلحَمدُ للہ Al-hamdulillah, today on Dhulqa'dah 9, 1391-H (September 1971), the commentary on Surah Al-Qasas has concluded in such conditions that Pakistan was attacked by India and the unholy alliance of the big powers. For fourteen days Karachi was bombarded daily. The city was severely damaged. Hundreds of Muslims were martyred, and many a houses were demolished. Fourteen days war finished on the sad note that East Pakistan is cut off from Pakistan, and about ninety thousand troops have surrendered there. Killing is still going on in East Pakistan. Every Muslim is stuck with grief and bewilderment.</p><p>إِنَّا لِلَّـهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَ‌اجِعُونَ و الیہ المشتکی ولا منجا من اللہ اِلَّا اِلیہ</p>"

These trials and tribulations sometimes come as a result of enmity of the infidels and sinners by way of afflictions, as have been experienced by the Holy Prophet ﷺ and many other prophets, and at times in the form of diseases, as was experienced by Sayyidna Ayyub (علیہ السلام) .

Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) was the nephew of Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) . He was the very first one to accept faith after watching the miracle of Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) in the fire of Namrild. When Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) planned to migrate from his hometown, Kutha - a township of Kufah - along with his wife Sayyidah Sarah, who was his cousin and had accepted Islam, and Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) he said إِنِّي مُهَاجِرٌ‌ إِلَىٰ رَ‌بِّي .

However, some other commentators are of the view that إِنِّي مُهَاجِرٌ‌ إِلَىٰ رَ‌بِّي (I am going to leave my homeland) was said by Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) . But in the present context, the former explanation appears more appropriate. Although Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) had accompanied Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) during this journey, but being subordinate to him, his separate mention was not called for, like Sayyidah Sarah, who was subordinate to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) ، was not mentioned separately.</p><p>First prophetic migration in world's history</p><p>Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) was the first prophet who had to migrate from his hometown for the sake of religion.

That is, ` We rewarded Ibrahim for his sacrifices in the way of Allah and righteous actions in this world also'. He is made popular and the Imam among the people of the world. He is respected by all alike, whether Jews, Christians or idol worshippers. In the Hereafter he will be among the Salihin (righteous) of the Paradise. It clarifies that although the real reward for good deeds will be awarded in the Hereafter, but a small part of it is also given in this world. Some authentic ahadith have also described about the award of benefits in this world against good deeds, and depraved outcome of the bad deeds. Maulana Hakim-ul-Ummah (رح) has put together all such acts in his booklet ` Jaza'-ul-A` mal' (جَزَاّء الاَعمَال ).</p>"

Other commentators have reported that these insolent people were in the habit of committing sins openly before all others.</p><p>Out of the three sins mentioned in this verse the first one is most disgusting, which was never committed before in the whole world, and even wild beasts abstain from it. The entire ummah is unanimous on that it is a worse sin than adultery. (Ruh)</p>"

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>اتْلُ مَا أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ (And recite (0 Muhammad) what is revealed to you - 29:45). In the previous verses some incidents of a few prophets and their people were related, in which some rebellious infidels were also mentioned, who faced various divine punishments. There were also some words of solace for the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and consolation for the believers, in that how the earlier prophets had endured various types of hardships. There was also persuasion for continuing the work of teaching and preaching, and not to lose heart under any circumstances.</p><p>A brief but comprehensive formula for the reform of people</p><p>In the above verses the Holy Prophet ﷺ is advised a brief but comprehensive formula for inviting people towards Allah. If acted upon, this formula opens the avenues leading to practicing religion with all its precept, and the natural hurdles that come in the way in practicing it are removed easily. This elixir formula is made up of two parts; one is the recitation of the Holy Qur'an, and the other, establishment of prayers. Although the real object here was to make all people adhere to the two basics, but for the sake of persuasion and emphasis, the Holy Prophet ﷺ was directed first to practice them, because it was much easy for the followers to act upon the teachings of Islam when they saw the Holy Prophet ﷺ practicing it.</p><p>Out of the two components of the formula, recitation of Qur'an is the spirit behind and foundation of everything. The next in order is the establishment of prayers, which has been selected for mentioning here to the exclusion of all other acts and obligations. The wisdom behind placing prayer above all other worships has also been explained that it keeps one away from shameless and obscene acts. The prayer is supreme among all the worships and obligations in its own right, and is a pillar to the religion. Fahsha' are all those shameless and obscene acts and utterances that are regarded bad and vile in all societies, no matter Islamic or non-Islamic, for instance, adultery, murder, abduction, robbery, lying, etc. Munkar (translated above as 'evil' ) is that act or utterance on which there is unanimity of opinion of all religious jurists as being impermissible or Haram. Therefore, if there is a difference of opinion by the religious jurists, no one of the two views can be regarded as munkar. The two words, fahasha' and munkar, encompass in them all the crimes, and sins - both open and concealed - which are mischievous by themselves and a great hurdle in the way of righteous deeds.</p><p>How does prayer stop from all sins?</p><p>According to innumerous authentic ahadith, this verse means that there is a peculiar effect of the establishment of salah (prayer) that whoever performs it stops committing sins, provided it is not offered just for the sake of offering. One should offer prayers strictly in accordance with the wordings of Qur'an, that is for its iqamah (establishment). The meaning of iqamah of Salah is to perform it both inwardly and outwardly with the manners and mores the Holy Prophet ﷺ used to perform. All along his life, he stressed that the body, clothes and the place of offering prayer should be clean. Offering prayer in congregation, and to perform all actions in line with Sunnah are outward mores of the prayer. As for inward mores, one should stand in prayer with fear of Allah and humility in a manner that he is begging from Him. The one who establishes prayer, Allah Ta’ ala graces him with Divine help to tread the righteous path, and to keep away from all types of sins. If someone does not get rid of sins despite offering prayers, then there is some flaw in his prayers. It is mentioned in a hadith reported by Sayyidna ` Imran Ibn Husain ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ was asked about the sense of the verse by إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ‌ (Surely, Salah restrains from shamelessness and evil - 29:45). The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied, مَن لَّم َتنھَہ عَنِ الفَحشآءِ وَالمُنکَرِ فَلَا صَلوٰۃَ لَہُ (رواہ ابن ابی حاتم بسندہ عن عمران بن حُصَین والطبرابی من حدیث ابی معاویۃ) That is ` if anyone's prayer did not stop him from his sins then his prayer is nothing'.</p><p>Sayyidna Ibn Masud ؓ has reported that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said لَا صلوٰۃ لِمَن لَّم یُطِعِ الصَّلوٰۃ (Ibn Jarir), that is ` one who does not obey his prayer his prayer is nothing'. The obedience of prayer is that one should keep away from sins (fahsha' and munkar).</p><p>While interpreting this verse Sayyidna Ibn ` Abbas ؓ has said that if someone's prayer does not make him do the righteous deeds and prevent from sins, then such a prayer would draw him even farther from Allah Ta’ ala.</p><p>Ibn Kathir has reproduced all the three narrations in one place and has concluded that these ahadith are not marfu` which means that these words are not the words spoken by the Holy Prophet ﷺ but are the expositions put forward in explaining this verse by the three scholars namely, ` Imran Ibn Husain, ` Abdullah Ibn Masud, Ibn ` Abbas and Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ has reported in a narration that someone came to the Holy Prophet ﷺ\tand said ` a person offers tahajjud (night</p><p>prayer) at night, and steals after the day break'. The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied, ` The prayer will soon desist him from stealing'. (Ibn Kathir) Some other narrations have also related that after this remark from him he stopped stealing.</p><p>Answer to a doubt</p><p>Some persons express their doubt that many a people offer prayers regularly and yet indulge in grave sins, which apparently looks in conflict with this verse. Some have replied to this doubt by explaining that Salah forbids those offering prayers from sins, but it is not necessary that all take up the advice in right earnest, and stop committing sins. After all Qur'an and hadith also desist everyone from committing sins, yet many do not pay any attention to the advice, and do not refrain from sinning.</p><p>But most commentators have explained that the verse is not in the form of a command, but it is the effect of prayer, which desists those who offer their prayers regularly from committing sins, by Divine help. But if one is not graced with the Divine help to get rid of sins, it means that there is some flaw in his prayers, and he has not been able to fulfill the requirements of iqamah of Salah. Above referred ahadith also endorse this view.</p><p>وَلَذِكْرُ‌ اللَّـهِ أَكْبَرُ‌ وَاللَّـهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَصْنَعُونَ (And indeed remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing). And Allah knows what you do. - 29:45). Here remembrance of Allah could mean the remembrance carried out in the prayer or otherwise is supreme. The other meaning of the word could be that when His servants remember Him, it is His promise that He too remembers them before angels فَاذْكُرُ‌ونِي أَذْكُرْ‌كُمْ (Remember Me, and I will remember you - 2:152). For the servants who worship Allah it is the biggest blessing. Many a companions and the generation that followed them have endorsed this interpretation. Ibn Jarir and Ibn Kathir رحمۃ اللہ علیہما have also preferred this view. There is also an allusion under this view that the real reason of getting rid of sins through prayers is that Allah Ta’ ala also remembers the servant at that time before the angels. Thus its auspiciousness relieves him from his sins.</p>"

If you give them tit for tat, you are justified, although it is still preferable that they are not replied with rudeness for rudeness, and cruelly for their cruelty. Rather they be treated with courtesy for their rudeness, and with fairness for their unfairness.

Hence, you have no reason for any hostility against us'.</p><p>Does this verse endorse the authenticity of Torah and Injil in their present form?</p><p>The manner in which this verse endorses the belief of Muslims in Torah and Injil is their general faith in them, as they were revealed in their original form. It means that whatever Allah Ta’ ala had revealed in these books, they had faith in that. It does not mean that they have faith in their altered and distorted form of the text as well. Many of the alterations were made in the books even before the time of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and many more were carried out later. This work on amendments has not ceased yet. Muslims have faith only on that part of Torah and Injil that were revealed on Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) and Sayyidna Isa (علیہ السلام) respectively. The altered part of the books is excluded from that.</p><p>Torah and Injil in their present form can neither be believed nor rejected altogether</p><p>It is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari that Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ has reported that the People of the Book used to read Torah and Injil in their original language, Hebrew, but for Muslims they would relate only its translation in Arabic. the Holy Prophet ﷺ instructed the Muslims in this regard that they should neither believe nor reject what they (Jews and Christians) tell them, and instead simply say آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ (We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you - 29:46). That is ` We have symbolic faith in that what was revealed on your prophets, but what you are telling us we do not consider it as authentic. Therefore, we abstain from endorsing or rejecting it'.</p>"

The altered part of the books is excluded from that.</p><p>Torah and Injil in their present form can neither be believed nor rejected altogether</p><p>It is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari that Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ has reported that the People of the Book used to read Torah and Injil in their original language, Hebrew, but for Muslims they would relate only its translation in Arabic. the Holy Prophet ﷺ instructed the Muslims in this regard that they should neither believe nor reject what they (Jews and Christians) tell them, and instead simply say آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ (We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you - 29:46). That is ` We have symbolic faith in that what was revealed on your prophets, but what you are telling us we do not consider it as authentic. Therefore, we abstain from endorsing or rejecting it'.</p>"

Furthermore, it would not be an honour for him to be labeled as literate, rather the honour is in him being an unlettered.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>From the very beginning of this Surah until now the enmity of the infidels toward Muslims, their rejection of the Oneness of God and prophethood of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، and putting hurdles in the way of truth and believers were described. In the above verses a way out of this entanglement is suggested in order to come out of the turmoil and spread and propagate the truth, and establish justice - the common name for this action is hijrah (migration).It means to leave the hometown and land where one is forced to speak and act against the truth.</p><p>Command in connection with hijrah and removal of doubts encountering in its way</p><p>إِنَّ أَرْ‌ضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ (Surely My earth is vast. So, Me alone you worship - 29:56). Allah Ta’ ala has made it clear that His land is very vast and no one should have the excuse that he could not observe the Oneness of Allah, and could not worship Him because in a certain city or country the infidels were in power. It is made clear in these verses that the Muslims should leave the land for the sake of Allah where they are forced to get involved in infidelity and sin, and should try to find out a place for living where they could abide by the commands of Allah Ta’ ala, and persuade others also to follow the same. This is what hijrah is all about.</p><p>During the course of migration one is likely to encounter, as a rule, two types of risks, which may hold him back from migration. The first risk is to his life in that the infidels and his adversaries would come in his way, and in order to obstruct his move might take up arms to finish him. In addition, there could be a possibility of his being caught by adversaries on his way out. Hence, there is yet another risk to his life.</p>"

Therefore, it should not be the trait of a Muslim to be afraid of death, because despite all possible defenses one may arrange for himself, death will overcome him. And it is also part of a believer's faith that death cannot come before the time Allah has determined. Therefore, fear of death should not be an impediment in one's decision about his staying at a certain place or leaving it. If death comes during the course of following a command from Allah Ta’ ala, it would bring eternal blessings and comforts, which one will get in the Hereafter, as stated in the next two verses:</p>"

Ants do not come out of their holes in winter; hence store the food during the summer season. Among the birds crow is the only one that collects food in its nest, but then forgets it. Thus, all the countless animals living on earth are those who neither collect their food for the next day, nor do they have means to do so. It is stated in a hadith that all the birds set off from their nests at dawn in a state of hunger, and return in the evening satiated.

      "text": "<p>Commentary</p><p>In the preceding verses it was said about the infidels and disbelievers that if they were asked about the creation of the earth and skies, the solar system, the water cycle and its effect on growth of vegetation, they would reply that all this is created and controlled by Allah Ta a1a. They did not believe that any one had any involvement in their creation or control, yet in their worship they associate idols with Allah. The reason for this is أَكْثَرُ‌هُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ (Most of them do not understand - 29:63).</p><p>At this point the question arises that, after all, they were not insane but intelligent and sensible people. They performed many important and skillful jobs. Then, how have they lost their balance of mind? The answer to this query is given in the first of the above verses by saying that they are lost in the love of material attractions of the world, which are mortal and would disappear soon. They are totally oblivious of the life hereafter, which would last forever. The life of this world is nothing more than a pastime for amusement and fun, but the real and lasting life is that of Hereafter. وَمَا هَـٰذِهِ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا لَهْوٌ وَلَعِبٌ وَإِنَّ الدَّارَ‌ الْآخِرَ‌ةَ لَهِيَ الْحَيَوَانُ (And this worldly life is nothing but an amusement and play, and the Last Abode is the real life indeed. - 29:64). Here the word Hayawan is used in the sense of hayah (life) (Qurtubi).</p><p>In this verse the life of this world is held to be an amusement and play. It means that as amusements are finished and gone after a while and do not have any objective or lasting impact, the mundane attractions are also similar in nature.</p><p>In the next verse, yet another bad habit of the disbelievers is pointed out. Despite believing that Allah Ta’ ala is unique and solitary in His creation, they associate idols with Him ignorantly. Then, it is all the more surprising that whenever they are hit by some calamity, they have the firm belief that none of their idols had the power to take them out of that. They know well that it is only Allah who can remove the calamity, and none of their idols could do anything. To elaborate this point a paradigm is illustrated in verse 65: ` when they are on a journey in the river and there is a risk of their drowning, they call out only Allah to get rid of it, and not any of their idols'. Allah Ta’ ala listens to their prayer, as being totally helpless at that moment, they break off temporarily all their contacts with false gods and look upon Him only. So, He brings them out of the storm safely. But soon after the wretched people reach the land safely, they forget about His grace in no time, and start calling the idols as His associates.

The real meaning of jihad is to put in all efforts to remove the hurdles in the way of faith.

It means that when there is a 'confusion between evil and virtue, truth and false, and profit or loss, and a wise person wonders which way to adopt, on such occasions Allah Ta’ ala guides those striving in His way to the path which is straight, righteous and without risk. In other words, He turns their hearts toward a way that may bring the divine blessing and the best results.</p><p>Knowledge improves if it is acted upon</p><p>Sayyidna Abu Ad-Darda' ؓ while interpreting this verse has said that the people who strive for acting in accordance with their knowledge are promised by Allah Ta’ ala in this verse that He will disclose to them some other areas of knowledge that they did not have before.
