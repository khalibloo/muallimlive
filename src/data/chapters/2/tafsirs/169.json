      "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madina</h2><h2>Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah</h2><p>The Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah </p><p>In Musnad Ahmad, Sahih Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَجْعَلُوا بُيُوتَكُمْ قُبُورًا فَإِنَّ الْبَيْتَ الَّذِي تُقْرَأُ فِيهِ سُورَةُ الْبَقَرَةِ لَا يَدْخُلُهُ الشَّيْطَان»</div><p>(Do not turn your houses into graves. Verily, Shaytan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.) At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih. </p><p>Also, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Shaytan flees from the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is heard.\" This Hadith was collected by An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak, and then said that its chain of narration is authentic, although the Two Sahihs did not collect it. In his Musnad, Ad-Darimi recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Shaytan departs the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is being recited, and as he leaves, he passes gas.\" Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Shaytan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (255), the following two Ayat (256-257) and the last three Ayat.\" In another narration, Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Then Shaytan will not come near him or his family, nor will he be touched by anything that he dislikes. Also, if these Ayat were to be recited over a senile person, they would wake him up.\" </p><p>Further, Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ سَنَامًا، وَإِنَّ سَنَامَ الْقُرْآنِ الْبَقَرَةُ، وَإِنَّ مَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ لَيْلَةً لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَ لَيَالٍ، وَمَنْ قَرَأَهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ نَهَارًا لَمْ يَدْخُلْهُ الشَّيْطَانُ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّام»</div><p>(Everything has a hump (or, high peek), and Al-Baqarah is the high peek of the Qur'an. Whoever recites Al-Baqarah at night in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three nights. Whoever recites it during a day in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three days.) This Hadith was collected by Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani, Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and Ibn Marduwyah. </p><p>At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah sent an expedition force comprising of many men and asked each about what they memorized of the Qur'an. The Prophet came to one of the youngest men among them and asked him, `What have you memorized (of the Qur'an) young man' He said, `I memorized such and such Surahs and also Al-Baqarah.' The Prophet said, `You memorized Surat Al-Baqarah' He said, `Yes.' The Prophet said, `Then you are their commander.' One of the noted men (or chiefs) commented, `By Allah! I did not learn Surat Al-Baqarah, for fear that I would not be able to implement it. The Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَعَلَّمُوا القُرْآنَ وَاقْرَءُوهُ، فَإِنَّ مَثَلَ الْقُرْآنِ لِمَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَقَرَأَ وَقَامَ بِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ مَحْشُوَ مِسْكًا يَفُوحُ رِيحُهُ فِي كُلِّ مَكَانٍ، وَمَثَلُ مَنْ تَعَلَّمَهُ فَيَرْقُدُ وَهُوَ فِي جَوْفِهِ كَمَثَلِ جِرَابٍ أُوكِيَ عَلى مِسْك»</div><p>(Learn Al-Qur'an and recite it, for the example of whoever learns the Qur'an, recites it and adheres to it, is the example of a bag that is full of musk whose scent fills the air. The example of whoever learns the Qur'an and then sleeps (i.e. lazy) while the Qur'an is in his memory, is the example of a bag that has musk, but is closed tight.) </p><p>This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi, who said that this Hadith is Hasan. In another narration, At-Tirmidhi recorded this same Hadith in a Mursal manner, so Allah knows best. </p><p>Also, Al-Bukhari recorded that Usayd bin Hudayr said that he was once reciting Surat Al-Baqarah while his horse was tied next to him. The horse started to make some noise. When Usayd stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving about. When he resumed reading, the horse started moving about again. When he stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving, and when he resumed reading, the horse started to move again. Meanwhile, his son Yahya was close to the horse, and he feared that the horse might step on him. When he moved his son back, he looked up to the sky and saw a cloud radiating with light that looked like lamps. In the morning, he went to the Prophet and told him what had happened and then said, \"O Messenger of Allah! My son Yahya was close to the horse and I feared that she might step on him. When I attended to him and raised my head to the sky, I saw a cloud with lights like lamps. So I went, but I couldn't see it.\" The Prophet said, \"Do you know what that was\" He said, \"No.\" The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تِلْكَ الْمَلَائِكَةُ دَنَتْ لِصَوْتِكَ وَلَو قَرَأْتَ لَأَصْبَحْتَ يَنْظُرُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهَا، لَا تَتَوارَى مِنْهُم»</div><p>(They were the angels, they came close hearing your voice (reciting Surat Al-Baqarah), and if you had kept reading, the people would have been able to see the angels when the morning came, and the angels would not be hidden from their eyes.) </p><p>This is the narration reported by Imam Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an. </p><h2>Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah and Surat Al `Imran</h2><p>Imam Ahmad said that Abu Nu`aym narrated to them that Bishr bin Muhajir said that `Abdullah bin Buraydah narrated to him from his father, \"I was sitting with the Prophet and I heard him say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَعَلَّمُوا سُورَةَ الْبَقَرَةِ فَإِنَّ أَخْذَهَا بَرَكَةٌ، وَتَرْكَهَا حَسْرَةٌ، وَلَا تَسْتَطِيعُهَا الْبَطَلَة»</div><p>(Learn Surat Al-Baqarah, because in learning it there is blessing, in ignoring it there is sorrow, and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.) </p><p>He kept silent for a while and then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَعَلَّمُوا سُورَةَ الْبَقَرَةِ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ فَإِنَّهُمَا الزَّهْرَاوَانِ، يُظِلَّانِ صَاحِبَهُمَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ أَوْ غَيَايَتَانِ أَوْ فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، وَإِنَّ الْقُرآنَ يَلْقى صَاحِبَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ حِينَ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ قَبْرُهُ كَالرَّجُلِ الشَّاحِبِ فَيَقُولُ لَهُ: هَلْ تَعْرِفُنِي؟ فَيَقُولُ: مَا أَعْرِفُكَ. فَيَقُولُ: أَنَا صَاحِبُكَ الْقُرْآنُ الَّذِي أَظْمَأْتُكَ فِي الْهَوَاجِرِ وَأَسْهَرْتُ لَيْلَكَ وَإِنَّ كُلَّ تَاجِرٍ مِنْ وَرَاءِ تِجَارَتِهِ، وَإِنَّكَ الْيَوْمَ مِنْ وَرَاءِ كُلِّ تِجَارَةٍ فَيُعْطَى الْمُلْكَ بِيَمِينِهِ وَالْخُلْدَ بِشِمَالِهِ وَيُوضَعُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ تَاجُ الْوَقَارِ، وَيُكْسَى وَالِدَاهُ حُلَّتَانِ لَا يَقُومُ لَهُمَا أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا، فَيَقُولَانِ: بِمَا كُسِينَا هَذَا؟ فَيُقَالُ: بِأَخْذِ وَلَدِكُمَا الْقُرْآنَ ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: اقْرَأْ وَاصْعَدْ فِي دَرَجِ الْجَنَّةِ وَغُرَفِهَا، فَهُوَ فِي صُعُودٍ مَا دَامَ يَقْرأُ هَذًّا كَانَ أَوْ تَرْتِيلًا»</div><p>(Learn Surat Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran because they are two lights and they shade their people on the Day of Resurrection, just as two clouds, two spaces of shade or two lines of (flying) birds. The Qur'an will meet its companion in the shape of a pale-faced man on the Day of Resurrection when his grave is opened. The Qur'an will ask him, 'Do you know me' The man will say, 'I do not know you.' The Qur'an will say, 'I am your companion, the Qur'an, which has brought you thirst during the heat and made you stay up during the night. Every merchant has his certain trade. But, this Day, you are behind all types of trade.' Kingship will then be given to him in his right hand, eternal life in his left hand and the crown of grace will be placed on his head. His parents will also be granted two garments that the people of this life could never afford. They will say, 'Why were we granted these garments' It will be said, 'Because your son was carrying the Qur'an.' It will be said (to the reader of the Qur'an), 'Read and ascend through the levels of Paradise.' He will go on ascending as long as he recites, whether reciting slowly or quickly.)\" </p><p>Ibn Majah also recorded part of this Hadith from Bishr bin Al-Muhajir, and this chain of narrators is Hasan, according to the criteria of Imam Muslim. </p><p>A part of this Hadith is also supported by other Hadiths. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اقْرَأُوا الْقُرْآنَ فَإِنَّهُ شَافِعٌ لِأَهْلِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ اقْرَأُوا الزَّهْرَاوَيْنِ، الْبَقَرَةَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ، فَإِنَّهُمَا يَأْتِيَانِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ، أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا غَيَايَتَانِ أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، يُحَاجَّانِ عَنْ أَهْلِهِمَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Read the Qur'an, because it will intercede on behalf of its people on the Day of Resurrection. Read the two lights, Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran, because they will come in the shape of two clouds, two shades or two lines of birds on the Day of Resurrection and will argue on behalf of their people on that Day.) </p><p>The Prophet then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">« اقْرَأُوا الْبَقَرَةَ فَإِنَّ أَخْذَهَا بَرَكَةٌ وَتَرْكَهَا حَسْرَةٌ وَلَا تَسْتَطِيعُهَا الْبَطَلَة»</div><p>(Read Al-Baqarah, because in having it there is blessing, and in ignoring there is a sorrow and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.) </p><p>Also, Imam Muslim narrated this Hadith in the Book of Prayer </p><p>Imam Ahmad narrated that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُؤْتَى بِالقُرْآنِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَهْلِهِ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ بِهِ تَقْدَمُهُم سُورَةُ الْبَقَرَةِ وَآلُ عِمْرَان»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and its people who used to implement it will be brought forth, preceded by Surat Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran.) </p><p>An-Nawwas said, \"The Prophet set three examples for these two Surahs and I did not forget these examples ever since. He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَأَنَّهُمَا غَمَامَتَانِ، أَوْ ظُلَّتَانِ سَودَاوَانِ بَيْنَهُمَا شَرْقٌ، أَوْ كَأَنَّهُمَا فِرْقَانِ مِنْ طَيْرٍ صَوَافَّ، يُحَاجَّانِ عَنْ صَاحِبِهِمَا»</div><p>(They will come like two clouds, two dark shades or two lines of birds arguing on behalf of their people.) </p><p>It was also recorded in Sahih Muslim and At-Tirmidhi narrated this Hadith, which he rendered Hasan Gharib. </p><h2>Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><p>There is no disagreement over the view that Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in its entirety in Al-Madinah. Moreover, Al-Baqarah was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Al-Madinah, while, Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.) (2:281) was the last Ayah to be revealed from the Qur'an. Also, the Ayat about usury were among the last Ayat to be revealed. Khalid bin Ma`dan used to call Al-Baqarah the Fustat (tent) of the Qur'an. Some of the scholars said that it contains a thousand news incidents, a thousand commands and a thousand prohibitions. Those who count said that the number of Al-Baqarah's Ayat is two hundred and eighty-seven, and its words are six thousand two hundred and twenty-one words. Further, its letters are twenty-five thousand five hundred. Allah knows best. </p><p>Ibn Jurayj narrated that `Ata' said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah.\" Also, Khasif said from Mujahid that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said; \"Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah.\" Several Imams and scholars of Tafsir issued similar statements, and there is no difference of opinion over this as we have stated. </p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn Mas`ud kept the Ka`bah on his left side and Mina on his right side and threw seven pebbles (at the Jamrah) and said, \"The one to whom Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed (i.e. the Prophet ) performed Rami (the Hajj rite of throwing pebbles) similarly.\" The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. </p><p>Further, Ibn Marduwyah reported a Hadith of Shu`bah from `Aqil bin Talhah from `Utbah bin Marthad; \"The Prophet saw that his Companions were not in the first lines and he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا أَصْحَابَ سُورَةِ الْبَقَرَة»</div><p>(O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah.) I Think that this incident occurred during the battle of Hunayn when the Companions retreated. Then, the Prophet commanded Al-`Abbas (his uncle) to yell out, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا أَصْحَابَ الشَّجَرَة»</div><p>(O Companions of the tree!) meaning the Companions who participated in the pledge of Ar-Ridwan (under the tree). In another narration, Al- `Abbas cried, \"O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah!\" encouraging them to come back, so they returned from every direction. Also, during the battle of Al-Yamamah, against the army of Musaylimah the Liar, the Companions first retreated because of the huge number of soldiers in Musaylimah's army. The Muhajirun and the Ansar called out for each other, saying; \"O people of Surat Al-Baqarah!\" Allah then gave them victory over their enemy, may Allah be pleased with all of the companions of all the Messengers of Allah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful </p><h2>The Discussion of the Individual Letters</h2><p>The individual letters in the beginning of some Surahs are among those things whose knowledge Allah has kept only for Himself. This was reported from Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali and Ibn Mas`ud. It was said that these letters are the names of some of the Surahs. It was also said that they are the beginnings that Allah chose to start the Surahs of the Qur'an with. Khasif stated that Mujahid said, \"The beginnings of the Surahs, such as Qaf, Sad, Ta Sin Mim and Alif Lam Ra, are just some letters of the alphabet.\" Some linguists also stated that they are letters of the alphabet and that Allah simply did not cite the entire alphabet of twenty-eight letters. For instance, they said, one might say, \"My son recites Alif, Ba, Ta, Tha... \" he means the entire alphabet although he stops before mentioning the rest of it. This opinion was mentioned by Ibn Jarir. </p><h2>The Letters at the Beginning of Surahs</h2><p>If one removes the repetitive letters, then the number of letters mentioned at the beginning of the Surahs is fourteen: Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad, Ra, Kaf, Ha, Ya, `Ayn, Ta, Sin, Ha, Qaf, Nun. </p><p>So glorious is He Who made everything subtly reflect His wisdom. </p><p>Moreover, the scholars said, \"There is no doubt that Allah did not reveal these letters for jest and play.\" Some ignorant people said that some of the Qur'an does not mean anything, (meaning, such as these letters) thus committing a major mistake. On the contrary, these letters carry a specific meaning. Further, if we find an authentic narration leading to the Prophet that explains these letters, we will embrace the Prophet's statement. Otherwise, we will stop where we were made to stop and will proclaim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ءَامَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا</div><p>(We believe in it; all of it (clear and unclear verses) is from our Lord) (3:7). </p><p>The scholars did not agree on one opinion or explanation regarding this subject. Therefore, whoever thinks that one scholar's opinion is correct, he is obliged to follow it, otherwise it is better to refrain from making any judgment on this matter. Allah knows best. </p><h2>These Letters testify to the Miraculous Qur'an</h2><p>The wisdom behind mentioning these letters in the beginning of the Surahs, regardless of the exact meanings of these letters, is that they testify to the miracle of the Qur'an. Indeed, the servants are unable to produce something like the Qur'an, although it is comprised of the same letters with which they speak to each other. This opinion was mentioned by Ar-Razi in his Tafsir who related it to Al-Mubarrid and several other scholars. Al-Qurtubi also related this opinion to Al-Farra' and Qutrub. Az-Zamakhshari agreed with this opinion in his book, Al-Kashshaf. In addition, the Imam and scholar Abu Al-`Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah and our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Hajjaj Al-Mizzi agreed with this opinion. Al-Mizzi told me that it is also the opinion of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. KAz-Zamakhshari said that these letters, \"Were not all mentioned once in the beginning of the Qur'an. Rather, they were repeated so that the challenge (against the creation) is more daring. Similarly, several stories were mentioned repeatedly in the Qur'an, and also the challenge was repeated in various areas (i.e., to produce something like the Qur'an). Sometimes, one letter at a time was mentioned, such as Sad, Nun and Qaf. Sometimes two letters were mentioned, such as </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حـم </div><p>(Ha Mim) (44:1) Sometimes, three letters were mentioned, such as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم </div><p>(Alif Lam Mim (2: 1)) and four letters, such as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">المر</div><p>(`Alif Lam Mim Ra) (13:1), and </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">المص </div><p>(Alif Lam Mim Sad) (7:1). </p><p>Sometimes, five letters were mentioned, such as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كهيعص </div><p>(Kaf Ha Ya `Ayn Sad) (19:1), and; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حـم - عسق</div><p>(Ha Mim. `Ayn Sin Qaf) (42:1-2). </p><p>This is because the words that are used in speech are usually comprised of one, two, three, four, or five letters.\" </p><p>Every Surah that begins with these letters demonstrates the Qur'an's miracle and magnificence, and this fact is known by those well-versed in such matters. The count of these Surahs is twenty-nine. For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim) This is the Book (the Qur'an), wherein there is no doubt (2:1-2), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم - اللهُ لا إلَهَ إلاَّ هُوَ اَلْحَيُّ القَيُّومُ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَٰـبَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim. Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyuum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you (Muhammad ) with truth, confirming what came before it.) (3:1-3), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">المص كِتَٰـبٌ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلاَ يَكُن فِى صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِّنْهُ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim Sad. (This is the) Book (the Qur'an) sent down unto you (O Muhammad ), so let not your breast be narrow therefrom) (7:1-2). </p><p>Also, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الر كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَٰـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ</div><p>(Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad ) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into the light (of belief in the Oneness of Allah and Islamic Monotheism) by their Lord's leave) (14:1), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم - تَنْزِيلُ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَالَمينَ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim.

(32:1-2), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حـم - تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div><p>(Ha Mim.

Likewise Allah, the Almighty, the Wise sends revelation to you (O Muhammad ) as (He sent revelation to) those before you.) (42:1-3). </p><p>There are several other Ayat that testify to what we have mentioned above, and Allah knows best.</p>"

In addition, Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"I do not know of any disagreement over this explanation.\" The meaning of this is that the Book, the Qur'an, is without a doubt revealed from Allah.

That is because the Qur'an is itself a form of guidance, but the guidance in it is only granted to the righteous, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُمْ مَّوْعِظَةٌ مَّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَآءٌ لِّمَا فِى الصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i. e. the Qur'an, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that (disease of ignorance, doubt, hypocrisy and differences) which is in your breasts, ـ a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers) (10:57). </p><p>Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(guidance for the Muttaqin (the pious and righteous persons), means, a light for those who have Taqwa. </p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Muttaqin</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said about, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(guidance for the Muttaqin) that it means, \"They are the believers who avoid Shirk with Allah and who work in His obedience.\" Ibn `Abbas also said that Al-Muttaqin means, \"Those who fear Allah's punishment, which would result if they abandoned the true guidance that they recognize and know. They also hope in Allah's mercy by believing in what He revealed.\" Further, Qatadah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(Al-Muttaqin), are those whom Allah has described in His statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ</div><p>(Who believe in the Ghayb and perform the Salah) (2:3), and the following Ayat. Ibn Jarir stated that the Ayah (2:2) includes all of these meanings that the scholars have mentioned, and this is the correct view. Also, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrated that `Atiyah As-Sa`di said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَبْلُغُ الْعَبْدُ أَنْ يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ حَتَّى يَدَعَ مَالَا بَأْسَ بِهِ حَذَرًا مِمَّا بِهِ بَأْس»</div><p>(The servant will not acquire the status of the Muttaqin until he abandons what is harmless out of fear of falling into that which is harmful.) At-Tirmidhi then said \"Hasan Gharib.\" </p><h2>There are Two Types of Hidayah (Guidance)</h2><p>Huda here means the faith that resides in the heart, and only Allah is able to create it in the heart of the servants. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ</div><p>(Verily, you (O Muhammad ) guide not whom you like) (28:56), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ</div><p>(Not upon you (Muhammad ) is their guidance) (2:272), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ</div><p>(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him) (7:186), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</div><p>(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right path)) (18:17). </p><p>Huda also means to explain the truth, give direction and lead to it. Allah, the Exalted, said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(And verily, you (O Muhammad ) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path (i.e. Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)) (42: 52), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ</div><p>(You are only a warner, and to every people there is a guide) (13:7), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَٰـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</div><p>(And as for Thamud, We showed and made clear to them the path of truth (Islamic Monotheism) through Our Messenger (i.e. showed them the way of success), but they preferred blindness to guidance) (41:17). </p><p>testifying to this meaning. </p><p>Also, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهَدَيْنَٰـهُ النَّجْدَينِ</div><p>(And shown him the two ways (good and evil).) (90:10) </p><p>This is the view of the scholars who said that the two ways refer to the paths of righteousness and evil, which is also the correct explanation. And Allah knows best. </p><h2>Meaning of Taqwa</h2><p>The root meaning of Taqwa is to avoid what one dislikes. It was reported that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Ubayy bin Ka`b about Taqwa. Ubayy said, \"Have you ever walked on a path that has thorns on it\" `Umar said, \"Yes.\" Ubayy said, \"What did you do then\" He said, \"I rolled up my sleeves and struggled.\" Ubayy said, \"That is Taqwa.\" </p>"

Also, Ma`mar said that Az-Zuhri said, \"Iman is the deeds.\" In addition, Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that, `They have faith', means, they fear (Allah). </p><p>Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) commented, \"The prefered view is that they be described as having faith in the Unseen by the tongue, deed and creed. In this case, fear of Allah is included in the general meaning of Iman, which necessitates following deeds of the tongue by implementation. Hence, Iman is a general term that includes affirming and believing in Allah, His Books and His Messengers, and realizing this affirmation through adhering to the implications of what the tongue utters and affirms.\" </p><p>Linguistically, in the absolute sense, Iman merely means trust, and it is used to mean that sometimes in the Qur'an, for instance, Allah the Exalted said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(He trusts (yu'minu) in Allah, and trusts (yu'minu) in the believers.)

Some scholars explained that Iman means Khashyah (fear of Allah). For instance, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ</div><p>(Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen (i.e. they do not see Him, nor His punishment in the Hereafter)) (67:12), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ خَشِىَ الرَّحْمَٰـنَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَجَآءَ بِقَلْبٍ مُّنِيبٍ</div><p>(Who feared the Most Gracious (Allah) in the Ghayb (unseen) and brought a heart turned in repentance (to Him and absolutely free from every kind of polytheism)) (50: 33). </p><p>Fear is the core of Iman and knowledge, just as Allah the Exalted said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</div><p>(It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah) (35:28). </p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Ghayb</h2><p>As for the meaning of Ghayb here, the Salaf have different explanations of it, all of which are correct, indicating the same general meaning. For instance, Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi quoted Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, reporting from Abu Al-`Aliyah about Allah's statement, i </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</div><p>((Those who) have faith in the Ghayb), \"They believe in Allah, His angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, His Paradise, Fire and in the meeting with Him. They also believe in life after death and in Resurrection. All of this is the Ghayb.\" Qatadah bin Di`amah said similarly. </p><p>Sa`id bin Mansur reported from `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid who said, \"We were sitting with `Abdullah bin Mas`ud when we mentioned the Companions of the Prophet and their deeds being superior to our deeds. `Abdullah said, `The matter of Muhammad was clear for those who saw him. By He other than Whom there is no God, no person will ever acquire a better type of faith than believing in Al-Ghayb.' He then recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم - ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim. This is the Book, wherein there is no doubt, a guidance for the Muttaqin. Those who believe in the Ghayb), until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(the successful). \" Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwyah and Al-Hakim, in his Mustadrak, recorded this Hadith. Al-Hakim commented that this Hadith is authentic and that the Two Shaykhs - Al-Bukhari and Muslim - did not collect it, although it meets their criteria. </p><p>Ahmad recorded a Hadith with similar meaning from Ibn Muhayriz who said: I said to Abu Jumu`ah, \"Narrate a Hadith for us that you heard from the Messenger of Allah.\" He said, \"Yes. I will narrate a good Hadith for you. Once we had lunch with the Messenger of Allah . Abu `Ubaydah, who was with us, said, `O Messenger of Allah! Are people better than us We embraced Islam with you and performed Jihad with you.' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ قَوْمٌ مِنْ بَعْدِكُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِي وَلَمْ يَرَوْنِي»</div><p>(Yes, those who will come after you, who will believe in me although they did not see me.)\" </p><p>This Hadith has another route collected by Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah in his Tafsir, from Salih bin Jubayr who said: `Abu Jumu`ah Al-Ansari, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah , came to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) to perform the prayer. Raja' bin Haywah was with us, so when Abu Jumu`ah finished, we went out to greet him. When he was about to leave, he said, \"You have a gift and a right. I will narrate a Hadith for you that I heard from the Messenger of Allah. \" We said, \"Do so, and may Allah grant you mercy.\" He said, \"We were with the Messenger of Allah, ten people including Mu`adh bin Jabal. We said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Are there people who will acquire greater rewards than us We believed in Allah and followed you.' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا يَمْنَعُكُمْ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَرَسُولُ اللهِ بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِالْوَحْيِ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، بَلْ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَكُمْ يَأْتِيهِمْ كِتَابٌ مِنْ بَيْنِ لَوْحَيْنِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَيَعْمَلُونَ بِمَا فِيهِ، أُولٰئِكَ أَعْظَمُ مِنْكُمْ أَجْرًا مَرَّتَيْن»</div><p>(What prevents you from doing so, while the Messenger of Allah is among you, bringing you the revelation from heaven There are people who will come after you and who will be given a book between two covers (the Qur'an), and they will believe in it and implement its commands. They have a greater reward than you, even twice as much.)\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</div><p>(And perform Salah, and spend out of what we have provided for them) </p><h2>Meaning of Iqamat As-Salah</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلٰوةَ</div><p>(And perform the Salah), means, \"Perform the prayer with all of the obligations that accompany it.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Iqamat As-Salah means to complete the bowings, prostrations, recitation, humbleness and attendance for the prayer.\" Qatadah said, \"Iqamat As-Salah means to preserve punctuality, and the ablution, bowings, and prostrations of the prayer.\" Muqatil bin Hayyan said Iqamat As-Salah means \"To preserve punctuality for it, as well as completing ones purity for it, and completing the bowings, prostrations, recitation of the Qur'an, Tashahhud and blessings for the Prophet . This is Iqamat As-Salah.\" </p><h2>The Meaning of \"Spending\" in this Ayah</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</div><p>(And spend out of what We have provided for them) means, \"The Zakah due on their wealth.\" As-Suddi said that Abu Malik and Abu Salih narrated from Ibn `Abbas, as well as Murrah from Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions of the Messenger of Allah , that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</div><p>(And spend out of what We have provided for them) means, \"A man's spending on his family. This was before the obligation of Zakah was revealed.\" Juwaybir narrated from Ad-Dahhak, \"General spending (in charity) was a means of drawing nearer to Allah, according to one's discretion and capability. Until the obligation of charity was revealed in the seven Ayat of Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9), were revealed. These abrogated the previous case.\" </p><p>In many instances, Allah mentioned prayer and spending wealth together. Prayer is a right of Allah as well as a form of worshipping Him. It includes singling Him out for one's devotion, praising Him, glorifying Him, supplicating to Him, invoking Him, and it displays one's dependence upon Him. Spending is form of kindness towards creatures by giving them what will benefit them, and those people most deserving of this charity are the relatives, the wife, the servants and then the rest of the people. So all types of required charity and required spending are included in Allah's saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰـهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</div><p>(And spend out of what we have provided for them). The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُنِيَ الْإِسْلَامُ عَلَى خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَاةِ، وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ، وَحَجِّ الْبَيْت»</div><p>(Islam is built upon five (pillars): Testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing the prayer, giving Zakah, fasting Ramadan and Hajj to the House.) </p><p>There are many other Hadiths on this subject. </p><h2>The Meaning of Salah</h2><p>In the Arabic language, the basic meaing of Salah is supplication. In religious terminology, Salah is used to refer to the acts of bowing and prostration, the remaining specified acts associated with it, specificed at certain times, with those known conditions, and the characteristics, and requirements that are well-known about it. </p>"

All of these attributes complement each other and require the existence of the other attributes.

For instance, the Prophet stated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا حَدَثَكُمْ أَهْلُ الْكِتَابِ فَلَا تُكَذِّبُوهُمْ وَلَا تُصَدِقُوهُمْ وَلكِنْ قُولُوا: آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُم»</div><p>(When the People of the Book narrate to you, neither reject nor affirm what they say.

Therefore, Allah sealed their hearts, hearing and sight, and they could neither see the guidance nor hear, comprehend or understand.\" Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَتَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ</div><p>(Allah has set a seal on their hearts), \"A stamp. It occurs when sin resides in the heart and surrounds it from all sides, and this submersion of the heart in sin constitutes a stamp, meaning a seal.\" Ibn Jurayj also said that the seal is placed on the heart and the hearing. In addition, Ibn Jurayj said, that `Abdullah bin Kathir narrated that Mujahid said, \"The stain is not as bad as the stamp, the stamp is not as bad as the lock which is the worst type.\" Al-A`mash said, \"Mujahid demonstrated with his hand while saying, `They used to say that the heart is just like this - meaning the open palm. When the servant commits a sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up - and he rolled up his index finger. When the servant commits another sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up' - and he rolled up another finger, until he rolled up all of his fingers. Then he said, `Then, the heart will be sealed.' Mujahid also said that this is the description of the Ran (refer to 83:14).\" </p><p>Al-Qurtubi said, \"The Ummah has agreed that Allah has described Himself with sealing and closing the hearts of the disbelievers, as a punishment for their disbelief. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ</div><p>(Nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief) (4:155).\" </p><p>He then mentioned the Hadith about changing the hearts, (in which the Prophet supplicated), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مُقَلِبَ الْقُلُوبِ ثَبِّتْ قُلُوبَنَا عَلى دِينِك»</div><p>(O You Who changes the hearts, make our hearts firm on Your religion.) </p><p>He also mentioned the Hadith by Hudhayfah recorded in the Sahih, in which the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تُعْرَضُ الْفِتَنُ عَلَى الْقُلُوبِ كَالْحَصِيرِ عُودًا عُودًا، فَأَيُّ قَلْبٍ أُشْرِبَهَا نُكِتَ فِيه نُكْتَةٌ سَوْدَاءُ وَأَيُّ قَلْبٍ أَنْكَرَهَا نُكِتَ فِيهِ نُكْتَةٌ بَيْضَاءُ حَتى تَصِيرَ عَلَى قَلْبَيْنِ: عَلى أَبْيَضَ مِثْلِ الصَّفَا، فَلَا تَضُرُّهُ فِتْنَةٌ مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ وَالْآخَرُ أَسْوَدُ مُرْبَادًّا كَالْكُوزِ مُجَخِّيًا لَا يَعْرِفُ مَعْرُوفًا وَلَا يُنْكِرُ مُنْكَرًا»</div><p>(The Fitan (trials, tests) are offered to the hearts, just as the straws that are sewn into a woven mat, one after another. Any heart that accepts the Fitan, then a black dot will be engraved on it. Any heart that rejects the Fitan, then a white dot will be engraved on it. The hearts will therefore become two categories: white, just like the barren rock; no Fitnah shall ever harm this category as long as the heavens and earth still exist. Another category is black, just as the cup that is turned upside down, for this heart does not recognize righteousness or renounce evil. ) </p><p>Ibn Jarir said, \"The truth regarding this subject is what the authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah stated. Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْمُؤمِنَ إِذَا أَذْنَبَ ذَنْبًا كَانَتْ نُكْتَةً سَوْدَاءَ فِي قَلْبِهِ، فَإِنْ تَابَ وَنَزَعَ وَاسْتَعْتَبَ صَقِلَ قَلْبُهُ وَإِنْ زَادَ زَادَتْ حَتَّى تَعْلُوَ قَلْبَهُ، فَذلِكَ الرَّانُ الَّذِي قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ بَلْ رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(When the believer commits a sin, a black dot will be engraved on his heart. If he repents, refrains and regrets, his heart will be polished again. If he commits more errors, the dots will increase until they cover his heart. This is the Ran (stain) that Allah described, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ بَلْ رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ </div><p>(Nay!

The two last Ayat (2:6-7) describe the disbelievers. Afterwards, Allah begins to describe the hypocrites who show belief and hide disbelief. Since the matter of the hypocrites is vague and many people do not realize their true reality, Allah mentioned their description in detail. Each of the characteristics that Allah used to described them with is a type of hypocrisy itself. Allah revealed Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) and Surat Al-Munafiqun (chapter 63) about the hypocrites. He also mentioned the hypocrites in Surat An-Nur (24) and other Surahs, so that their description would be known and their ways and errors could be avoided. Allah said, </p>"

Nifaq has several types: Nifaq in the creed that causes its people to reside in Hell for eternity, and Nifaq in deed, which is one of the major sins, as we will explain soon, Allah willing. Ibn Jurayj said of the hypocrite that, \"His actual deeds are different from what he publicizes, what he conceals is different from what he utters, his entrance and presence are not the same as his exit and absence.\" </p><h2>The Beginning of Hypocrisy</h2><p>The revelations about the characteristics of the hypocrites were revealed in Al-Madinah, this is because there were no hypocrites in Makkah. Rather the opposite was the situation in Makkah, since some people were forced to pretend that they were disbelievers, while their hearts concealed their faith. Afterwards, the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, where the Ansar from the tribes of Aws and Khazraj resided. They used to worship idols during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance, just as the rest of the Arab idolators. Three Jewish tribes resided in Al-Madinah, Banu Qaynuqa`-allies of Al-Khazraj, Banu An-Nadir and Banu Qurayzah-allies of the Aws. Many members of the Aws and Khazraj tribes embraced Islam. However, only a few Jews embraced Islam, such as `Abdullah bin Salam. During the early stage in Al-Madinah, there weren't any hypocrites because the Muslims were not strong enough to be feared yet. On the contrary, the Messenger of Allah conducted peace treaties with the Jews and several other Arab tribes around Al-Madinah. Soon after, the battle of Badr occurred and Allah gave victory to Islam and its people. `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was a leader in Al-Madinah. He was Al-Khazraj's chief, and during the period of Jahiliyyah he was the master of both tribes - Aws and Khazraj. They were about to appoint him their king when the Message reached Al-Madinah, and many in Al-Madinah embraced Islam. Ibn Salul's heart was filled with hatred against Islam and its people. When the battle of Badr took place, he said, \"Allah's religion has become apparent.\" So he pretended to be Muslim, along with many of those who were just like him, as well as many among the People of the Book. It was then that hypocrisy began in Al-Madinah and among the surrounding nomad tribes. As for the Emigrants, none of them were hypocrites, since they emigrated willingly (seeking the pleasure of Allah). Rather, when a Muslim would emigrate from Makkah, he would be forced to abandon all of his wealth, offspring and land; he would do so seeking Allah's reward in the Hereafter. </p><h2>The Tafsir of Ayah 2:8</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الأْخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And of mankind, there are some who say: \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day\" while in fact they do not believe) \"This refers to the hypocrites among the Aws and Khazraj and those who behaved as they did.\" </p><p>This is how Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi explained this Ayah. Allah revealed the characteristics of the hypocrites, so that the believers would not be deceived by their outer appearance, thus saving the believers from a great evil. Otherwise, the believers might think that the hypocrites were believers, when in reality they are disbelievers. To consider the sinners as righteous people is extremely dangerous, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالْيَوْمِ الأْخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And of mankind, there are some who say: \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day\" while in fact they do not believe) meaning, they utter these false statements only with their tongues, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا جَآءَكَ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ قَالُواْ نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ</div><p>(When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad ), they say: \"We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.\" Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger) (63:1). </p><p>This Ayah means that the hypocrites utter these statements only when they meet you, not because they actually believe what they are saying. The hypocrites emphasize their belief in Allah and the Last Day with their words, when that is not the case in reality. Therefore, Allah stated that the hypocrites lie in their testimony of creed, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ لَكَـذِبُونَ</div><p>(And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.)

They think that by doing this, they will mislead Allah, or that the statements they utter will help them with Allah, and this is an indication of their total ignorance. They think that such behavior will deceive Allah, just as it might deceive some of the believers.

Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ </div><p>(While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and grants them their piety) (47:17). </p><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْذِبُونَ</div><p>(Because they used to tell lies). The hypocrites have two characteristics, they lie and they deny the Unseen. </p><p>The scholars who stated that the Prophet knew the hypocrites of his time have only the Hadith of Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman as evidence. In it the Prophet gave him the names of fourteen hypocrites during the battle of Tabuk. These hypocrites plotted to assassinate the Prophet during the night on a hill in that area. They planned to excite the Prophet's camel, so that she would throw him down the hill. Allah informed the Prophet about their plot, and the Prophet told Hudhayfah their names. </p><p>As for the other hypocrites, Allah said about them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ الاٌّعْرَابِ مُنَـفِقُونَ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ الْمَدِينَةِ مَرَدُواْ عَلَى النَّفَاقِ لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</div><p>(And among the bedouins around you, some are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Al-Madinah who persist in hypocrisy; you (O Muhammad ) know them not, We know them) (9:101), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً - مَّلْعُونِينَ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُواْ أُخِذُواْ وَقُتِّلُواْ تَقْتِيلاً </div><p>(If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah do not cease, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while. Accursed, they shall be seized wherever found, and killed with a (terrible) slaughter) (33:60-61). </p><p>These Ayat prove that the Prophet was not informed about each and everyone among the hypocrites of his time. Rather, the Prophet was only informed about their characteristics, and he used to assume that some people possessed these characteristics. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لأَرَيْنَـكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</div><p>(Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) (47:30). </p><p>The most notorious hypocrite at that time was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul; Zayd bin Arqam - the Companion - gave truthful testimony to that effect. In addition, `Umar bin Al-Khattab once mentioned the matter of Ibn Salul to the Prophet , who said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَتَحَدَّثَ الْعَرَبُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَه»</div><p>(I would not like the Arabs to say to each other that Muhammad is killing his Companions.) </p><p>Yet, when Ibn Salul died, the Prophet performed the funeral prayer for him and attended his funeral just as he used to do with other Muslims. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي خُيِّرْتُ فَاخْتَرْت»</div><p>(I was given the choice (to pray for him or not), so I chose.) </p><p>In another narration, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَعْلَمُ أَنِّي لَوْ زِدْتُ عَلَى السَّبْعِينَ يُغْفَرُ لَهُ لَزِدْت»</div><p>(If I knew that by asking (Allah to forgive Ibn Salul) more than seventy times that He would forgive him, then I would do that.) </p>"

Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, \"We are with you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(Verily, we were but mocking), meaning, we only mock people (the believers) and deceive them.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(Verily, we were but mocking), means, \"We (meaning the hypocrites) were mocking the Companions of Muhammad.\" Also, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah said similarly. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِىءُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </div><p>(Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly) answers the hypocrites and punishes them for their behavior.

Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said: \"Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!\" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.) (57:13), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ لاًّنفُسِهِمْ إِنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُواْ إِثْمَاً</div><p>(And let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing of their punishment is good for them. We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness.) (3:178).\" </p><p>He then said, \"This, and its like, is Allah's mockery of the hypocrites and the people of Shirk.\" </p><h2>The Hypocrites suffering for their Plots</h2><p>Allah stated that He will punish the hypocrites for their mockery, using the same terms to describe both the deed and its punishment, although the meaning is different. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا فَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(The recompense for an offense is an offense equal to it; but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah) (42:40), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(Then whoever transgresses (the prohibition) against you, transgress likewise against him) (2:194). </p><p>The first act is an act of injustice, while the second act is an act of justice. So both actions carry the same name, while being different in reality. This is how the scholars explain deceit, cunning and mocking when attributed to Allah in the Qur'an. Surely, Allah exacts revenge for certain evil acts with a punishment that is similar in nature to the act itself. We should affirm here that Allah does not do these things out of joyful play, according to the consensus of the scholars, but as a just form of punishment for certain evil acts. </p><h2>Meaning of `Leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</div><p>(Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly). As-Suddi reported that Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and several other Companions of the Messenger of Allah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَمُدُّهُمْ</div><p>(and leaves them increasing) means, He gives them respite. Also, Mujahid said, \"He (causes their deviation) to increase.\" Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(Do they think that by the wealth and the children with which We augment them. (That) We hasten to give them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55-56). </p><p>Ibn Jarir commented, \"The correct meaning of this Ayah is `We give them increase from the view of giving them respite and leaving them in their deviation and rebellion.' Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </div><p>(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe in it the first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly). \" (6:110). </p><p>Tughyan used in this Ayah means to transgress the limits, just as Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ </div><p>(Verily, when the water Tagha (rose) beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship) (69:11). </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir said that the term `Amah, in the Ayah means, `deviation'. He also said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</div><p>(in their deviation to wander), \"In the misguidance and disbelief that has encompassed them, causing them to be confused and unable to find a way out of it. This is because Allah has stamped their hearts, sealed them, and blinded their vision. Therefore, they do not recognize guidance or find the way out of their deviation.\" </p>"

Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نِبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً شَيَـطِينَ الإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ يُوحِى بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُوراً</div><p>(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112). </p><h2>The Meaning of `Mocking</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ</div><p>(They say: \"Truly, we are with you\"). Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, \"We are with you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(Verily, we were but mocking), meaning, we only mock people (the believers) and deceive them.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(Verily, we were but mocking), means, \"We (meaning the hypocrites) were mocking the Companions of Muhammad.\" Also, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah said similarly. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِىءُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </div><p>(Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly) answers the hypocrites and punishes them for their behavior. Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah mentioned what He will do to them on the Day of Resurrection, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالْمُنَـفِقَـتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ارْجِعُواْ وَرَآءَكُمْ فَالْتَمِسُواْ نُوراً فَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُ بَابٌ بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ وَظَـهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ </div><p>(On the Day when the hypocrites ـ men and women ـ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said: \"Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!\" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.) (57:13), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ لاًّنفُسِهِمْ إِنَّمَا نُمْلِى لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُواْ إِثْمَاً</div><p>(And let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing of their punishment is good for them. We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness.) (3:178).\" </p><p>He then said, \"This, and its like, is Allah's mockery of the hypocrites and the people of Shirk.\" </p><h2>The Hypocrites suffering for their Plots</h2><p>Allah stated that He will punish the hypocrites for their mockery, using the same terms to describe both the deed and its punishment, although the meaning is different. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا فَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(The recompense for an offense is an offense equal to it; but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah) (42:40), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(Then whoever transgresses (the prohibition) against you, transgress likewise against him) (2:194). </p><p>The first act is an act of injustice, while the second act is an act of justice. So both actions carry the same name, while being different in reality. This is how the scholars explain deceit, cunning and mocking when attributed to Allah in the Qur'an. Surely, Allah exacts revenge for certain evil acts with a punishment that is similar in nature to the act itself. We should affirm here that Allah does not do these things out of joyful play, according to the consensus of the scholars, but as a just form of punishment for certain evil acts. </p><h2>Meaning of `Leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</div><p>(Allah mocks at them and leaves them increasing in their deviation to wander blindly). As-Suddi reported that Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and several other Companions of the Messenger of Allah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَمُدُّهُمْ</div><p>(and leaves them increasing) means, He gives them respite. Also, Mujahid said, \"He (causes their deviation) to increase.\" Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ </div><p>(Do they think that by the wealth and the children with which We augment them. (That) We hasten to give them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55-56). </p><p>Ibn Jarir commented, \"The correct meaning of this Ayah is `We give them increase from the view of giving them respite and leaving them in their deviation and rebellion.' Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </div><p>(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe in it the first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly). \" (6:110). </p><p>Tughyan used in this Ayah means to transgress the limits, just as Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ </div><p>(Verily, when the water Tagha (rose) beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship) (69:11). </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir said that the term `Amah, in the Ayah means, `deviation'. He also said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِي طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</div><p>(in their deviation to wander), \"In the misguidance and disbelief that has encompassed them, causing them to be confused and unable to find a way out of it. This is because Allah has stamped their hearts, sealed them, and blinded their vision. Therefore, they do not recognize guidance or find the way out of their deviation.\" </p>"

Ad-Dahhak said \"It is the clouds.\" However, the most accepted opinion is that it means the rain that comes down during, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ظُلُمَـتِ</div><p>(darkness), meaning, here, the doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَعْدٌ</div><p>(thunder) that shocks the hearts with fear.

But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers), meaning, their cautiousness does not benefit them because they are bound by Allah's all-encompassing will and decision. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلُ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْجُنُودِ - فِرْعَوْنَ وَثَمُودَ - بَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِى تَكْذِيبٍ - وَاللَّهُ مِن وَرَآئِهِمْ مُّحِيطٌ </div><p>(Has the story reached you of two hosts. Of Fir`awn (Pharaoh) and Thamud Nay! The disbelievers (persisted) in denying. And Allah encompasses them from behind!)

Also, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(The lightning almost snatches away their sight), \"The Qur'an mentioned almost all of the secrets of the hypocrites.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah also narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ</div><p>(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein), \"Whenever the hypocrites acquire a share in the victories of Islam, they are content with this share. Whenever Islam suffers a calamity, they are ready to revert to disbelief.\". Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ</div><p>(And among mankind is he who worships Allah on the edge: If good befalls him, he is content with that.)

Some of them will gain light that illuminates over a distance of several miles, some more, some less. Some people's light will glow sometimes and be extinguished at other times. They will, therefore, walk on the Sirat (the bridge over the Fire) in the light, stopping when it is extinguished. Some people will have no light at all, these are the hypocrites whom Allah described when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالْمُنَـفِقَـتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ارْجِعُواْ وَرَآءَكُمْ فَالْتَمِسُواْ نُوراً</div><p>(On the Day when the hypocrites ـ men and women ـ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us!

Their Light will run forward before them and (with their Records ـ Books of deeds) in their right hands. They will say: \"Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us and do not put it off till we cross over the Sirat (a slippery bridge over the Hell) safely and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things\") (66:8). </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(Their Light will run forward before them), \"They will pass on the Sirat. according to their deeds. The light that some people have will be as big as a mountain, while the light of others will be as big as a date tree. The people who will have the least light are those whose index fingers will sometimes be lit and extinguished at other times.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every person among the people of Tawhid (Islamic Monotheism) will gain a light on the Day of Resurrection. As for the hypocrite, his light will be extinguished. When the believers witness the hypocrite's light being extinguished, they will feel anxious. Hence, they will supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</div><p>(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).\" Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, everyone who has embraced the faith will be given a light. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will feel anxious and supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</div><p>(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).\" </p><h2>Types of Believers and Types of Disbelievers</h2><p>Consequently, there are several types of people. There are the believers whom the first four Ayat (2:2-5) in Surat Al-Baqarah describe. There are the disbelievers who were described in the next two Ayat. And there are two categories of hypocrites: the complete hypocrites who were mentioned in the parable of the fire, and the hesitant hypocrites, whose light of faith is sometimes lit and sometimes extinguished. The parable of the rain was revealed about this category, which is not as evil as the first category. </p><p>This is similar to the parables that were given in Surat An-Nur (chapter 24). Like the example of the believer and the faith that Allah put in his heart, compared to a brightly illuminated lamp, just like a rising star. This is the believer, whose heart is built on faith and receiving its support from the divine legislation that was revealed to it, without any impurities or imperfections, as we will come to know, Allah willing. </p><p>Allah gave a parable of the disbelievers who think that they have something, while in reality they have nothing; such people are those who have compounded ignorance. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39). </p><p>Allah then gave the example of ignorant disbelievers, simple in their ignorance. He said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ يَغْشَـهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَـتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَآ أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ اللَّهُ لَهُ نُوراً فَمَا لَهُ مِن نُورٍ </div><p>(Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light) (24:40). </p><p>Therefore, Allah divided the camp of the disbelievers into two groups, advocates and followers. Allah mentioned these two groups in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍ </div><p>(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious (disobedient to Allah) Shaytan (devil) (devoid of every kind of good)) (22:3), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ </div><p>(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah)) (22:8). </p><p>Furthermore, Allah has divided the group of the believers in the beginning of Surat Al-Waqi`ah (56) and at the end. He also divided them in Surat Al-Insan (76) into two groups, the Sabiqun (those who preceded), they are the \"near ones\" (Muqaribun) and Ashab Al-Yamin (the companions of the right), and they are righteous (Abrar). </p><p>In summary, these Ayat divide the believers into two categories, the near ones and righteous. Also, the disbelievers are of two types, advocates and followers. In addition, the hypocrites are divided into two types, pure hypocrites and those who have some hypocrisy in them. The Two Sahihs record that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ثَلَاثٌ مَنْ كُنَّ فِيهِ كَانَ مُنَافِقًا خَالِصًا، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ فِيهِ وَاحِدَةٌ مِنْهُنَّ كَانَتْ فِيهِ خَصْلَةٌ مِنَ النِّفَاقِ حَتَّى يَدَعَهَا: مَنْ إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَان»</div><p>(Whoever has the following three (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following three characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy, unless and until he gives it up. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. Whenever he is entrusted, he breaches the trust) </p><p>Hence, man might have both a part of faith and a part of hypocrisy, whether in deed, as this Hadith stipulates, or in the creed, as the Ayah (2:20) stipulates. </p><h2>Types of Hearts</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Sa`id saying that the Messenger of Allah said </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْقُلُوبُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: قَلْبٌ أَجْرَدُ فِيهِ مِثْلُ السِّرَاجِ يَزْهَرُ وَقَلْبٌ أَغْلَفُ مَرْبُوطٌ عَلى غِلَافِهِ وَقَلْبٌ مَنْكُوسٌ وَقَلْبٌ مُصْفَحٌ، فَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَجْرَدُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُؤْمِنِ فَسِرَاجُهُ فِيهِ نُورُهُ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَغْلَفُ فَقَلْبُ الْكَافِرِ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمَنْكُوسُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُنَافِقِ الْخَالِصِ عَرَفَ ثُمَّ أَنْكَرَ وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمُصْفَحُ فَقَلْبٌ فِيهِ إيمَانٌ وَنِفَاقٌ وَمَثَلُ الْإيمَانِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْبَقْلَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْمَاءُ الطَّيِّبُ وَمَثَلُ النِّفَاقِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْقُرْحَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْقَيْحُ وَالدَّمُ فَأَيُّ الْمَادَّتَيْنِ غَلَبَتْ عَلَى الْأُخْرَى غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْه»</div><p>(The hearts are four (types): polished as shiny as the radiating lamp, a sealed heart with a knot tied around its seal, a heart that is turned upside down and a wrapped heart. As for the polished heart, it is the heart of the believer and the lamp is the light of faith. The sealed heart is the heart of the disbeliever. The heart that is turned upside down is the heart of the pure hypocrite, because he had knowledge but denied it. As for the wrapped heart, it is a heart that contains belief and hypocrisy. The example of faith in this heart, is the example of the herb that is sustained by pure water. The example of hypocrisy in it, is the example of an ulcer that thrives on puss and blood. Whichever of the two substances has the upper hand, it will have the upper hand on that heart). This Hadith has a Jayid Hasan (good) chain of narration. </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَـرِهِمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things). Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَـرِهِمْ</div><p>(And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight), \"Because they abandoned the truth after they had knowledge in it.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(Certainly, Allah has power over all things). Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah is able to punish or pardon His servants as He wills.\" Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah only described Himself with the ability to do everything in this Ayah as a warning to the hypocrites of His control over everything, and to inform them that His ability completely encompasses them and that He is able to take away their hearing and sight.\" </p><p>Ibn Jarir and several other scholars of Tafsir stated that these two parables are about the same kind of hypocrite. So the `or' mentioned in, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(Or like a rainstorm from the sky) means `and', just as the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ ءَاثِماً أَوْ كَفُوراً</div><p>(And obey neither a sinner or a disbeliever among them). Therefore, `or' in the Ayah includes a choice of using either example for the hypocrites. Also, Al-Qurtubi said that `or' means, \"To show compatibility of the two choices, just as when one says, `Sit with Al-Hasan or Ibn Sirin.' According to the view of Az-Zamakhshari, `so it means each of these persons is the same as the other, so you may sit with either one of them.' The meaning of `or' thus becomes `either.' Allah gave these two examples of the hypocrites, because they both perfectly describe them.\" </p><p>I (Ibn Kathir) say, these descriptions are related to the type of hypocrite, because there is a difference between them as we stated. For instance, Allah mentioned these types in Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) when He repeated the statement, \"And among them\" three times, describing their types, characteristics, statements and deeds. So the two examples mentioned here describe two types of hypocrites whose characteristics are similar. For instance, Allah gave two examples in Surat An-Nur, one for the advocates of disbelief and one for the followers of disbelief, He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert) (24:39), until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ</div><p>(Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea) (24:40). </p><p>The first example is of the advocates of disbelief who have complex ignorance, while the second is about the followers who have simple ignorance. Allah knows best. </p>"

When they suffer from doubt, confusion and disbelief, their hearts are, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَصَيِّبٍ</div><p>(Like a Sayyib), meaning, \"The rain\", as Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, and several other Companions have confirmed as well as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata', Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak said \"It is the clouds.\" However, the most accepted opinion is that it means the rain that comes down during, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ظُلُمَـتِ</div><p>(darkness), meaning, here, the doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَعْدٌ</div><p>(thunder) that shocks the hearts with fear. The hypocrites are usually full of fear and anxiety, just as Allah described them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(They think that every cry is against them) (63: 4), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ وَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلَـكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ - لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً أَوْ مَغَـرَاتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلاً لَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ </div><p>(They swear by Allah that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid. Should they find refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto in a swift rush) (9:56-57). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْبَرْقَ</div><p>(The lightning), is in reference to the light of faith that is sometimes felt in the hearts of the hypocrites, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَجْعَلُونَ أَصْـبِعَهُمْ فِى ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ الصَّوَعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكـفِرِينَ</div><p>(They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers), meaning, their cautiousness does not benefit them because they are bound by Allah's all-encompassing will and decision. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلُ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْجُنُودِ - فِرْعَوْنَ وَثَمُودَ - بَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِى تَكْذِيبٍ - وَاللَّهُ مِن وَرَآئِهِمْ مُّحِيطٌ </div><p>(Has the story reached you of two hosts. Of Fir`awn (Pharaoh) and Thamud Nay! The disbelievers (persisted) in denying. And Allah encompasses them from behind!) (85:17-20). </p><p>Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(The lightning almost snatches away their sight) meaning, because the lightning is strong itself, and because their comprehension is weak and does not allow them to embrace the faith. Also, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَـرَهُمْ</div><p>(The lightning almost snatches away their sight), \"The Qur'an mentioned almost all of the secrets of the hypocrites.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah also narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ</div><p>(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein), \"Whenever the hypocrites acquire a share in the victories of Islam, they are content with this share. Whenever Islam suffers a calamity, they are ready to revert to disbelief.\". Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ</div><p>(And among mankind is he who worships Allah on the edge: If good befalls him, he is content with that.) (22:11). Also, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُواْ</div><p>(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still), \"They recognize the truth and speak about it. So their speech is upright, but when they revert to disbeleif, they again fall into confusion.\" This was also said by Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi, who narrated it from the Companions, and it is the most obvious and most correct view, and Allah knows best. </p><p>Consequently, on the Day of Judgment, the believers will be given a light according to the degree of their faith. Some of them will gain light that illuminates over a distance of several miles, some more, some less. Some people's light will glow sometimes and be extinguished at other times. They will, therefore, walk on the Sirat (the bridge over the Fire) in the light, stopping when it is extinguished. Some people will have no light at all, these are the hypocrites whom Allah described when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالْمُنَـفِقَـتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ارْجِعُواْ وَرَآءَكُمْ فَالْتَمِسُواْ نُوراً</div><p>(On the Day when the hypocrites ـ men and women ـ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said to them; \"Go back to you rear! Then seek a light!\") (57:13). </p><p>Allah described the believers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</div><p>(On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women ـ their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)) (57:12), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ لاَ يُخْزِى اللَّهُ النَّبِىَّ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(The Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet (Muhammad ) and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and (with their Records ـ Books of deeds) in their right hands. They will say: \"Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us and do not put it off till we cross over the Sirat (a slippery bridge over the Hell) safely and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things\") (66:8). </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(Their Light will run forward before them), \"They will pass on the Sirat. according to their deeds. The light that some people have will be as big as a mountain, while the light of others will be as big as a date tree. The people who will have the least light are those whose index fingers will sometimes be lit and extinguished at other times.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every person among the people of Tawhid (Islamic Monotheism) will gain a light on the Day of Resurrection. As for the hypocrite, his light will be extinguished. When the believers witness the hypocrite's light being extinguished, they will feel anxious. Hence, they will supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</div><p>(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).\" Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, everyone who has embraced the faith will be given a light. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will feel anxious and supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</div><p>(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).\" </p><h2>Types of Believers and Types of Disbelievers</h2><p>Consequently, there are several types of people. There are the believers whom the first four Ayat (2:2-5) in Surat Al-Baqarah describe. There are the disbelievers who were described in the next two Ayat. And there are two categories of hypocrites: the complete hypocrites who were mentioned in the parable of the fire, and the hesitant hypocrites, whose light of faith is sometimes lit and sometimes extinguished. The parable of the rain was revealed about this category, which is not as evil as the first category. </p><p>This is similar to the parables that were given in Surat An-Nur (chapter 24). Like the example of the believer and the faith that Allah put in his heart, compared to a brightly illuminated lamp, just like a rising star. This is the believer, whose heart is built on faith and receiving its support from the divine legislation that was revealed to it, without any impurities or imperfections, as we will come to know, Allah willing. </p><p>Allah gave a parable of the disbelievers who think that they have something, while in reality they have nothing; such people are those who have compounded ignorance. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39). </p><p>Allah then gave the example of ignorant disbelievers, simple in their ignorance. He said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ يَغْشَـهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَـتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَآ أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ اللَّهُ لَهُ نُوراً فَمَا لَهُ مِن نُورٍ </div><p>(Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light) (24:40). </p><p>Therefore, Allah divided the camp of the disbelievers into two groups, advocates and followers. Allah mentioned these two groups in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَـنٍ مَّرِيدٍ </div><p>(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious (disobedient to Allah) Shaytan (devil) (devoid of every kind of good)) (22:3), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ومِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَـدِلُ فِى اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَـبٍ مُّنِيرٍ </div><p>(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah)) (22:8). </p><p>Furthermore, Allah has divided the group of the believers in the beginning of Surat Al-Waqi`ah (56) and at the end. He also divided them in Surat Al-Insan (76) into two groups, the Sabiqun (those who preceded), they are the \"near ones\" (Muqaribun) and Ashab Al-Yamin (the companions of the right), and they are righteous (Abrar). </p><p>In summary, these Ayat divide the believers into two categories, the near ones and righteous. Also, the disbelievers are of two types, advocates and followers. In addition, the hypocrites are divided into two types, pure hypocrites and those who have some hypocrisy in them. The Two Sahihs record that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ثَلَاثٌ مَنْ كُنَّ فِيهِ كَانَ مُنَافِقًا خَالِصًا، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ فِيهِ وَاحِدَةٌ مِنْهُنَّ كَانَتْ فِيهِ خَصْلَةٌ مِنَ النِّفَاقِ حَتَّى يَدَعَهَا: مَنْ إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَان»</div><p>(Whoever has the following three (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following three characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy, unless and until he gives it up. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. Whenever he is entrusted, he breaches the trust) </p><p>Hence, man might have both a part of faith and a part of hypocrisy, whether in deed, as this Hadith stipulates, or in the creed, as the Ayah (2:20) stipulates. </p><h2>Types of Hearts</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Sa`id saying that the Messenger of Allah said </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْقُلُوبُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: قَلْبٌ أَجْرَدُ فِيهِ مِثْلُ السِّرَاجِ يَزْهَرُ وَقَلْبٌ أَغْلَفُ مَرْبُوطٌ عَلى غِلَافِهِ وَقَلْبٌ مَنْكُوسٌ وَقَلْبٌ مُصْفَحٌ، فَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَجْرَدُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُؤْمِنِ فَسِرَاجُهُ فِيهِ نُورُهُ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَغْلَفُ فَقَلْبُ الْكَافِرِ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمَنْكُوسُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُنَافِقِ الْخَالِصِ عَرَفَ ثُمَّ أَنْكَرَ وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمُصْفَحُ فَقَلْبٌ فِيهِ إيمَانٌ وَنِفَاقٌ وَمَثَلُ الْإيمَانِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْبَقْلَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْمَاءُ الطَّيِّبُ وَمَثَلُ النِّفَاقِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْقُرْحَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْقَيْحُ وَالدَّمُ فَأَيُّ الْمَادَّتَيْنِ غَلَبَتْ عَلَى الْأُخْرَى غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْه»</div><p>(The hearts are four (types): polished as shiny as the radiating lamp, a sealed heart with a knot tied around its seal, a heart that is turned upside down and a wrapped heart. As for the polished heart, it is the heart of the believer and the lamp is the light of faith. The sealed heart is the heart of the disbeliever. The heart that is turned upside down is the heart of the pure hypocrite, because he had knowledge but denied it. As for the wrapped heart, it is a heart that contains belief and hypocrisy. The example of faith in this heart, is the example of the herb that is sustained by pure water. The example of hypocrisy in it, is the example of an ulcer that thrives on puss and blood. Whichever of the two substances has the upper hand, it will have the upper hand on that heart).

According to the view of Az-Zamakhshari, `so it means each of these persons is the same as the other, so you may sit with either one of them.' The meaning of `or' thus becomes `either.' Allah gave these two examples of the hypocrites, because they both perfectly describe them.\" </p><p>I (Ibn Kathir) say, these descriptions are related to the type of hypocrite, because there is a difference between them as we stated. For instance, Allah mentioned these types in Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) when He repeated the statement, \"And among them\" three times, describing their types, characteristics, statements and deeds. So the two examples mentioned here describe two types of hypocrites whose characteristics are similar. For instance, Allah gave two examples in Surat An-Nur, one for the advocates of disbelief and one for the followers of disbelief, He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert) (24:39), until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ</div><p>(Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea) (24:40). </p><p>The first example is of the advocates of disbelief who have complex ignorance, while the second is about the followers who have simple ignorance. Allah knows best. </p>"

So either order, or I will do it.' Yahya said, 'My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet.' Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allah and praised him and then said, `Allah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them. The first is that you worship Allah alone and not associate any with Him. The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold.

Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him. I also command you to pray, for Allah directs His Face towards His servant's face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro. I also command you to fast. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allah than the scent of musk. I also command you to give charity. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, 'Can I pay a ransom for myself' He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself. I also command you to always remember Allah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.) </p><p>Al-Harith then narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَأَنَا آمُرُكُمْ بِخَمْسٍ اللهُ أَمَرَنِي بِهِنَّ: الْجَمَاعَةِ وَالسَّمْعِ وَالطَّاعَةِ وَالْهِجْرَةِ وَالْجِهَادِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ. فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ خَرَجَ مِنَ الْجَمَاعَةِ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ فَقَدْ خَلَعَ رَبْقَةَ الْإِسْلَامِ مِنْ عُنُقِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يُرَاجِعَ وَمَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى جَاهِلِيَّةٍ فَهُوَ مِنْ جُثَى جَهَنَّم»</div><p>قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى؟ فَقَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنَّ صَلَّى وَصَامَ وَزَعَمَ أَنَّهُ مُسْلِمٌ، فَادْعُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ عَلَى مَا سَمَّاهُمُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»</div><p>(And I order you with five commandments that Allah has ordered me. Stick to the Jama`ah (community of the faithful), listen and obey (your leaders) and perform Hijrah (migration) and Jihad for the sake of Allah. Whoever abandons the Jama`ah, even the distance of a hand span, will have removed the tie of Islam from his neck, unless he returns. Whoever uses the slogans of Jahiliyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance) he will be among those kneeling in Jahannam (Hellfire).) They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Even if he prays and fasts\" He said, (Even if he prays, fasts and claims to be Muslim. So call the Muslims with their names that Allah has called them: `The Muslims, the believing servants of Allah.') </p><p>This is a Hasan Hadith, and it contains the statement, \"Allah has created and sustains you, so worship Him and do not associate anything with Him in worship.\" This statement is relevant in the Ayat (2:21-22) we are discussing here and supports singling Allah in worship, without partners. </p><h2>Signs of Allah's Existence</h2><p>Several scholars of Tafsir, like Ar-Razi and others, used these Ayat as an argument for the existence of the Creator, and it is a most worthy method of argument. Indeed, whoever ponders over the things that exist, the higher and lower creatures, their various shapes, colors, behavior, benefits and ecological roles, then he will realize the ability, wisdom, knowledge, perfection and majesty of their Creator. Once a bedouin was asked about the evidence to Allah's existence, he responded, \"All praise is due to Allah! The camel's dung testifies to the existence of the camel, and the track testifies to the fact that someone was walking. A sky that holds the giant stars, a land that has fairways and a sea that has waves, does not all of this testify that the Most Kind, Most Knowledgeable exists\" </p><p>Hence, whoever gazes at the sky in its immensity, its expanse, and the various kinds of planets in it, some of which appear stationary in the sky - whoever gazes at the seas that surround the land from all sides, and the mountains that were placed on the earth to stabilize it, so that whoever lives on land, whatever their shape and color, are able to live and thrive - whoever reads Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ الْجِبَالِ جُدَدٌ بِيضٌ وَحُمْرٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَنُهَا وَغَرَابِيبُ سُودٌوَمِنَ النَّاسِ وَالدَّوَآبِّ وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَنُهُ كَذَلِكَ إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</div><p>(And among the mountains are streaks white and red, of varying colours and (others) very black. And likewise, men and Ad-Dawabb (moving (living) creatures, beasts) and cattle are of various colours. It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah) (35: 27-28). </p><p>Whoever thinks about the running rivers that travel from area to area bringing benefit, whoever ponders over what Allah has created on earth; various animals and plants of different tastes, scents, shapes and colors that are a result of unity between land and water, whoever thinks about all of this then he will realize that these facts testify to the existence of the Creator, His perfect ability, wisdom, mercy, kindness, generosity and His overall compassion for His creation. There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, nor is there a Lord besides Him, upon Him we rely and to Him we turn in repentance. There are numerous Ayat in the Qur'an on this subject. </p>"

When the servant remembers Allah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.) </p><p>Al-Harith then narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَأَنَا آمُرُكُمْ بِخَمْسٍ اللهُ أَمَرَنِي بِهِنَّ: الْجَمَاعَةِ وَالسَّمْعِ وَالطَّاعَةِ وَالْهِجْرَةِ وَالْجِهَادِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ. فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ خَرَجَ مِنَ الْجَمَاعَةِ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ فَقَدْ خَلَعَ رَبْقَةَ الْإِسْلَامِ مِنْ عُنُقِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ يُرَاجِعَ وَمَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى جَاهِلِيَّةٍ فَهُوَ مِنْ جُثَى جَهَنَّم»</div><p>قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى؟ فَقَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنَّ صَلَّى وَصَامَ وَزَعَمَ أَنَّهُ مُسْلِمٌ، فَادْعُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ عَلَى مَا سَمَّاهُمُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»</div><p>(And I order you with five commandments that Allah has ordered me. Stick to the Jama`ah (community of the faithful), listen and obey (your leaders) and perform Hijrah (migration) and Jihad for the sake of Allah. Whoever abandons the Jama`ah, even the distance of a hand span, will have removed the tie of Islam from his neck, unless he returns. Whoever uses the slogans of Jahiliyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance) he will be among those kneeling in Jahannam (Hellfire).) They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Even if he prays and fasts\" He said, (Even if he prays, fasts and claims to be Muslim. So call the Muslims with their names that Allah has called them: `The Muslims, the believing servants of Allah.') </p><p>This is a Hasan Hadith, and it contains the statement, \"Allah has created and sustains you, so worship Him and do not associate anything with Him in worship.\" This statement is relevant in the Ayat (2:21-22) we are discussing here and supports singling Allah in worship, without partners. </p><h2>Signs of Allah's Existence</h2><p>Several scholars of Tafsir, like Ar-Razi and others, used these Ayat as an argument for the existence of the Creator, and it is a most worthy method of argument. Indeed, whoever ponders over the things that exist, the higher and lower creatures, their various shapes, colors, behavior, benefits and ecological roles, then he will realize the ability, wisdom, knowledge, perfection and majesty of their Creator. Once a bedouin was asked about the evidence to Allah's existence, he responded, \"All praise is due to Allah! The camel's dung testifies to the existence of the camel, and the track testifies to the fact that someone was walking. A sky that holds the giant stars, a land that has fairways and a sea that has waves, does not all of this testify that the Most Kind, Most Knowledgeable exists\" </p><p>Hence, whoever gazes at the sky in its immensity, its expanse, and the various kinds of planets in it, some of which appear stationary in the sky - whoever gazes at the seas that surround the land from all sides, and the mountains that were placed on the earth to stabilize it, so that whoever lives on land, whatever their shape and color, are able to live and thrive - whoever reads Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ الْجِبَالِ جُدَدٌ بِيضٌ وَحُمْرٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَنُهَا وَغَرَابِيبُ سُودٌوَمِنَ النَّاسِ وَالدَّوَآبِّ وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَنُهُ كَذَلِكَ إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</div><p>(And among the mountains are streaks white and red, of varying colours and (others) very black. And likewise, men and Ad-Dawabb (moving (living) creatures, beasts) and cattle are of various colours. It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah) (35: 27-28). </p><p>Whoever thinks about the running rivers that travel from area to area bringing benefit, whoever ponders over what Allah has created on earth; various animals and plants of different tastes, scents, shapes and colors that are a result of unity between land and water, whoever thinks about all of this then he will realize that these facts testify to the existence of the Creator, His perfect ability, wisdom, mercy, kindness, generosity and His overall compassion for His creation. There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, nor is there a Lord besides Him, upon Him we rely and to Him we turn in repentance. There are numerous Ayat in the Qur'an on this subject. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Message of Messenger of Allah is True</h2><p>Allah begins to prove the truth of prophethood after He stated that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him. Allah said to the disbelievers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا</div><p>(And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our servant) meaning, Muhammad , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ</div><p>(then produce a Surah (chapter)) meaning, similar to what he brought to you. Hence, if you claim that what he was sent with did not come from Allah, then produce something similar to what he has brought to you, using the help of anyone you wish instead of Allah. However, you will not be able to succeed in this quest. Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شُهَدَآءَكُمُ</div><p>(your witnesses) means \"Aids.\" Also, As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said the Ayah means, \"Your partners, meaning, some other people to help you in that. Meaning then go and seek the help of your deities to support and aid you.\" Also, Mujahid said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَادْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم</div><p>(and call your witnesses) means, \"People, meaning, wise and eloquent men who will provide the testimony that you seek.\" </p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p>Allah challenged the disbelievers in various parts of the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said in Surat Al-Qasas (28:49), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Say (to them, O Muhammad ): \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two (the Tawrah (Torah) and the Qur'an), that I may follow it, if you are truthful\"). Also, Allah said in Surat Al-Isra' (17:88), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا </div><p>(Say: \"If mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\") Allah said in Surat Hud (11:13), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Or they say, \"He (Prophet Muhammad ) forged it (the Qur'an).\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!\"), and in Surat Yunus (10:37-38), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ أَن يُفْتَرَى مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَـكِن تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it (i.e. the Tawrah, and the Injil), and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. Laws decreed for mankind) ـ wherein there is no doubt ـ from the Lord of all that exists.) (Or do they say: \"He (Muhammad ) has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah (chapter) like it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\"). All of these Ayat were revealed in Makkah. </p><p>Allah also challenged the disbelievers in the Ayat that were revealed in Al-Madinah. In this Ayah, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ</div><p>(And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in Rayb) meaning, doubt. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا</div><p>(Concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our servant) meaning, Muhammad , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(then produce a Surah (chapter) the like thereof) meaning, similar to the Qur'an. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Ar-Razi. Ar-Razi said that this is the Tafsir of `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and the majority of the scholars. And he gave preference to this view and mentioned the fact that Allah has challenged the disbelievers as individuals and as groups, whether literate or illiterate, thus making the challenge truly complete. This type of challenge is more daring than simply challenging the disbelievers who might not be literate or knowledgeable. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it) (11:13), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ</div><p>(They could not produce the like thereof) (17:88). </p><p>Therefore, this is a general challenge to the Arab disbelievers, the most eloquent among all nations. Allah challenged the Arab disbelievers both in Makkah and Al-Madinah several times, especially since they had tremendous hatred and enmity for the Prophet and his religion. Yet, they were unable to succeed in answering the challenge, and this is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ</div><p>(But if you do it not, and you can never do it), indicating that they will never be able to answer the challenge. This is another miracle, in that, Allah clearly stated without doubt that the Qur'an will never be opposed or challenged by anything similar to it, for eternity. This is a true statement that has not been changed until the present and shall never change. How can anyone be able to produce something like the Qur'an, when the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who created everything How can the words of the created ever be similar to the Words of the Creator </p><h2>Examples of the Miracle of the Qur'an</h2><p>Whoever reads through the Qur'an will realize that it contains various levels of superiority through both the apparent and hidden meanings that it mentions. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الركِتَـبَأُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ</div><p>(Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book, the verses whereof are perfect (in every sphere of knowledge, etc.), and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is Wise and well-acquainted (with all things)) (11:1) </p><p>So the expressions in the Qur'an are perfect and its meanings are explained. Further, every word and meaning in the Qur'an is eloquent and cannot be surpassed. The Qur'an also mentioned the stories of the people of the past; and these accounts and stories occurred exactly as the Qur'an stated. Also, the Qur'an commanded every type of righteousness and forbade every type of evil, just as Allah stated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</div><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6:115). meaning, true in the stories it narrates and just in its Laws. The Qur'an is true, just and full of guidance. It does not contain exaggerations, lies or falsehood, unlike Arabic and other types of poems that contained lies. These poems, conform with the popular statement, \"The most eloquent speech is the one that contains the most lies!\" Sometimes, one would find a long poem that mainly contains descriptions of women, horses or alcohol. Or, the poem might contain praise or the description of a certain person, horse, camel, war, incident, fear, lion, or other types of items and objects. Such praise or descriptions do not bring any benefit, except shed light on the poet's ability to clearly and eloquently describe such items. Yet, one will only be able to find one or two sentences in many long poems that elaborate on the main theme of the poem, while the rest of the poem contains insignificant descriptions and repetitions. </p><p>As for the Qur'an, it is entirely eloquent in the most perfect manner, as those who have knowledge in such matters and understand Arabic methods of speech and expressions concur. When one reads through the stories in the Qur'an, he will find them fruitful, whether they were in extended or short forms, repeated or not. The more these stories are repeated, the more fruitful and beautiful they become. The Qur'an does not become old when one repeats reciting it, nor do the scholars ever get bored with it. When the Qur'an mentions the subject of warning and promises, it presents truths that would make solid, firm mountains shake, so what about the comprehending, understanding hearts When the Qur'an promises, it opens the hearts and the ears, making them eager to attain the abode of peace - Paradise - and to be the neighbors of the Throne of the Most Beneficent. For instance, on the subject of promises and encouragement, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do) (32:17), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>((There will be) therein all that inner selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever) (43:71). </p><p>On the subject of warning and discouragement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ الْبَرِّ</div><p>(Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up) (17:68), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَمِنتُمْ مَّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَمُورُ - أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ مِّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَـصِباً فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ </div><p>(Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My warning) (67:16-17). </p><p>On the subject of threats, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكُلاًّ أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ</div><p>(So We punished each (of them) for his sins) (29:40). Also, on the subject of soft advice, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ - مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ </div><p>(Tell Me, (even) if We do let them enjoy for years. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them) (26:205-207). </p><p>There are many other examples of the eloquence, beauty, and benefits of the Qur'an. </p><p>When the Qur'an is discussing Laws, commandments and prohibitions, it commands every type of righteous, good, pleasing and beneficial act. It also forbids every type of evil, disliked and amoral act. Ibn Mas`ud and other scholars of the Salaf said, \"When you hear what Allah said in the Qur'an, such as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</div><p>(O you who believe!), then listen with full attention, for it either contains a type of righteousness that Allah is enjoining, or an evil that He is forbidding.\" For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَأْمُرُهُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَـهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَـئِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالاٌّغْلَـلَ الَّتِى كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(He (Muhammad ) commands them for Al-Ma`ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat(i.e. all good and lawful things), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khaba'ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful things), he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them) (7:157). </p><p>When the Ayat mention Resurrection and the horrors that will occur on that Day, and Paradise and the Fire and the joys and safe refuge that Allah prepared for His loyal friends, or torment and Hell for His enemies, these Ayat contain glad tidings or warnings. The Ayat then call to perform good deeds and avoid evil deeds, making the life of this world less favorable and the Hereafter more favorable. They also establish the correct methods and guide to Allah's straight path and just legislation, all the while ridding the hearts of the evil of the cursed devil. </p><h2>The Qur'an is the Greatest Miracle given to the Prophet</h2><p>The Two Sahihs record that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ إِلَّا قَدْ أُعْطِيَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُه وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Every Prophet was given a miracle, the type of which brings mankind to faith. What I was given is a revelation that Allah sent down to me. Yet, I hope that I will have the most following on the Day of Resurrection.) </p><p>This is the wording narrated by Muslim. The Prophet stated that among the Prophets he was given a revelation, meaning, he was especially entrusted with the miraculous Qur'an that challenged mankind to produce something similar to it. As for the rest of the divinely revealed Books, they were not miraculous according to many scholars. Allah knows best. The Prophet was also aided with innumerable signs and indications that testify to the truth of his prophethood and what he was sent with, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. </p><h2>Meaning of `Stones</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ الَّتِى وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(Then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers) (2:24). </p><p>`Fuel' is wood, or similar substances, used to start and feed a fire. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا الْقَـسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً </div><p>(And as for the Qasitun (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell) (72:15), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you enter it. Had these (idols) been alihah (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein) (21:98-99). </p><p>The stones mentioned here are the giant, rotten, black, sulfuric stones that become the hottest when heated, may Allah save us from this evil end. It was also reported that the stones mentioned here are the idols and rivals that were worshipped instead of Allah, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah,are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:28). </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(prepared for the disbelievers) </p><p>It appears most obvious that it refers to the Fire that is fueled by men and stones, and it also may refer to the stones themselves. There is no contradiction between these two views, because they are dependent upon each other. `Prepared' means, it is `kept' and will surely touch those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger . Ibn Ishaq narrated that Muhammad said that `Ikrimah or Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(prepared for the disbelievers), </p><p>\"For those who embrace the disbelief that you (disbelievers) have embraced.\" </p><h2>Jahannam (Hellfire) exists now</h2><p>Many of the Imams of the Sunnah used this Ayah to prove that the Fire exists now. This is because Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ</div><p>(prepared) meaning, prepared and kept. There are many Hadiths on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَحَاجَّتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّار»</div><p>(Paradise and the Fire had an argument..) </p><p>Also, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْتَأْذَنَتِ النَّارُ رَبَّهَا فَقَالَتْ: رَبِّ أَكَلَ بَعضِي بَعْضًا فَأذِنَ لَهَا بِنَفَسَيْنِ: نَفَسٍ فِي الشِّتَاءِ وَنَفَسٍ فِي الصَّيْف»</div><p>(The Fire sought the permission of her Lord. She said, 'O my Lord! Some parts of me consumed the other parts.' And Allah allowed her two periods to exhale, one in winter and one in summer.) </p><p>Also, there is a Hadith recorded from Ibn Mas`ud that the Companions heard the sound of a falling object. When they asked about it, the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَذَا حَجَرٌ أُلْقِيَ بِهِ مِنْ شَفِيرِ جَهَنَّمَ مُنْذُ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً، الْآنَ وَصَلَ إِلى قَعْرِهَا»</div><p>(This is a stone that was thrown from the top of Jahannam seventy years ago, but only now reached its bottom.) This Hadith is in Sahih Muslim. </p><p>There are many Hadiths that are Mutawatir (narrated by many different chains of narrations) on this subject, such as the Hadiths about the eclipse prayer, the night of Isra' etc. </p><p>Allah's statements, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(Then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof) (2:23), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(A Surah (chapter) like it) (10:38) this includes the short and long Surahs of the Qur'an. Therefore, the challenge to creation stands with regards to both the long and short Surahs, and there is no disagreement that I know of on this fact between the scholars of old and new. Before he became Muslim, `Amr bin Al-`As met Musaylimah the Liar who asked him, \"What has recently been revealed to your fellow (meaning Muhammad ) in Makkah\" `Amr said, \"A short, yet eloquent Surah.\" He asked, \"What is it\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ </div><p>(By Al-`Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss,) (103:1-2) </p><p>Musaylimah thought for a while and said, \"A similar Surah was also revealed to me.\" `Amr asked, \"What is it\" He said, \"O Wabr, O Wabr (i.e. a wild cat), you are but two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is unworthy and thin.\" `Amr said, \"By Allah! You know that I know that you are lying.\" </p>"

Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شُهَدَآءَكُمُ</div><p>(your witnesses) means \"Aids.\" Also, As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said the Ayah means, \"Your partners, meaning, some other people to help you in that. Meaning then go and seek the help of your deities to support and aid you.\" Also, Mujahid said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَادْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم</div><p>(and call your witnesses) means, \"People, meaning, wise and eloquent men who will provide the testimony that you seek.\" </p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p>Allah challenged the disbelievers in various parts of the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said in Surat Al-Qasas (28:49), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Say (to them, O Muhammad ): \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two (the Tawrah (Torah) and the Qur'an), that I may follow it, if you are truthful\"). Also, Allah said in Surat Al-Isra' (17:88), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا </div><p>(Say: \"If mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\") Allah said in Surat Hud (11:13), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Or they say, \"He (Prophet Muhammad ) forged it (the Qur'an).\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!\"), and in Surat Yunus (10:37-38), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ أَن يُفْتَرَى مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَـكِن تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ - أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُواْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it (i.e. the Tawrah, and the Injil), and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. Laws decreed for mankind) ـ wherein there is no doubt ـ from the Lord of all that exists.) (Or do they say: \"He (Muhammad ) has forged it\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah (chapter) like it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\"). All of these Ayat were revealed in Makkah. </p><p>Allah also challenged the disbelievers in the Ayat that were revealed in Al-Madinah. In this Ayah, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ</div><p>(And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in Rayb) meaning, doubt. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا</div><p>(Concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our servant) meaning, Muhammad , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(then produce a Surah (chapter) the like thereof) meaning, similar to the Qur'an. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Ar-Razi. Ar-Razi said that this is the Tafsir of `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and the majority of the scholars. And he gave preference to this view and mentioned the fact that Allah has challenged the disbelievers as individuals and as groups, whether literate or illiterate, thus making the challenge truly complete. This type of challenge is more daring than simply challenging the disbelievers who might not be literate or knowledgeable. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it) (11:13), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ</div><p>(They could not produce the like thereof) (17:88). </p><p>Therefore, this is a general challenge to the Arab disbelievers, the most eloquent among all nations. Allah challenged the Arab disbelievers both in Makkah and Al-Madinah several times, especially since they had tremendous hatred and enmity for the Prophet and his religion. Yet, they were unable to succeed in answering the challenge, and this is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ</div><p>(But if you do it not, and you can never do it), indicating that they will never be able to answer the challenge. This is another miracle, in that, Allah clearly stated without doubt that the Qur'an will never be opposed or challenged by anything similar to it, for eternity. This is a true statement that has not been changed until the present and shall never change. How can anyone be able to produce something like the Qur'an, when the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who created everything How can the words of the created ever be similar to the Words of the Creator </p><h2>Examples of the Miracle of the Qur'an</h2><p>Whoever reads through the Qur'an will realize that it contains various levels of superiority through both the apparent and hidden meanings that it mentions. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الركِتَـبَأُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ</div><p>(Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book, the verses whereof are perfect (in every sphere of knowledge, etc.), and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is Wise and well-acquainted (with all things)) (11:1) </p><p>So the expressions in the Qur'an are perfect and its meanings are explained. Further, every word and meaning in the Qur'an is eloquent and cannot be surpassed. The Qur'an also mentioned the stories of the people of the past; and these accounts and stories occurred exactly as the Qur'an stated. Also, the Qur'an commanded every type of righteousness and forbade every type of evil, just as Allah stated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</div><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6:115). meaning, true in the stories it narrates and just in its Laws. The Qur'an is true, just and full of guidance. It does not contain exaggerations, lies or falsehood, unlike Arabic and other types of poems that contained lies. These poems, conform with the popular statement, \"The most eloquent speech is the one that contains the most lies!\" Sometimes, one would find a long poem that mainly contains descriptions of women, horses or alcohol. Or, the poem might contain praise or the description of a certain person, horse, camel, war, incident, fear, lion, or other types of items and objects. Such praise or descriptions do not bring any benefit, except shed light on the poet's ability to clearly and eloquently describe such items. Yet, one will only be able to find one or two sentences in many long poems that elaborate on the main theme of the poem, while the rest of the poem contains insignificant descriptions and repetitions. </p><p>As for the Qur'an, it is entirely eloquent in the most perfect manner, as those who have knowledge in such matters and understand Arabic methods of speech and expressions concur. When one reads through the stories in the Qur'an, he will find them fruitful, whether they were in extended or short forms, repeated or not. The more these stories are repeated, the more fruitful and beautiful they become. The Qur'an does not become old when one repeats reciting it, nor do the scholars ever get bored with it. When the Qur'an mentions the subject of warning and promises, it presents truths that would make solid, firm mountains shake, so what about the comprehending, understanding hearts When the Qur'an promises, it opens the hearts and the ears, making them eager to attain the abode of peace - Paradise - and to be the neighbors of the Throne of the Most Beneficent. For instance, on the subject of promises and encouragement, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِىَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do) (32:17), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>((There will be) therein all that inner selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever) (43:71). </p><p>On the subject of warning and discouragement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ الْبَرِّ</div><p>(Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up) (17:68), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَمِنتُمْ مَّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ فَإِذَا هِىَ تَمُورُ - أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ مِّن فِى السَّمَآءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَـصِباً فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ </div><p>(Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My warning) (67:16-17). </p><p>On the subject of threats, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكُلاًّ أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ</div><p>(So We punished each (of them) for his sins) (29:40). Also, on the subject of soft advice, the Qur'an said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ - مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ </div><p>(Tell Me, (even) if We do let them enjoy for years. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them) (26:205-207). </p><p>There are many other examples of the eloquence, beauty, and benefits of the Qur'an. </p><p>When the Qur'an is discussing Laws, commandments and prohibitions, it commands every type of righteous, good, pleasing and beneficial act. It also forbids every type of evil, disliked and amoral act. Ibn Mas`ud and other scholars of the Salaf said, \"When you hear what Allah said in the Qur'an, such as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ</div><p>(O you who believe!), then listen with full attention, for it either contains a type of righteousness that Allah is enjoining, or an evil that He is forbidding.\" For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَأْمُرُهُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَـهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَـئِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالاٌّغْلَـلَ الَّتِى كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(He (Muhammad ) commands them for Al-Ma`ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat(i.e. all good and lawful things), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khaba'ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful things), he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them) (7:157). </p><p>When the Ayat mention Resurrection and the horrors that will occur on that Day, and Paradise and the Fire and the joys and safe refuge that Allah prepared for His loyal friends, or torment and Hell for His enemies, these Ayat contain glad tidings or warnings. The Ayat then call to perform good deeds and avoid evil deeds, making the life of this world less favorable and the Hereafter more favorable. They also establish the correct methods and guide to Allah's straight path and just legislation, all the while ridding the hearts of the evil of the cursed devil. </p><h2>The Qur'an is the Greatest Miracle given to the Prophet</h2><p>The Two Sahihs record that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ إِلَّا قَدْ أُعْطِيَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُه وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Every Prophet was given a miracle, the type of which brings mankind to faith. What I was given is a revelation that Allah sent down to me. Yet, I hope that I will have the most following on the Day of Resurrection.) </p><p>This is the wording narrated by Muslim. The Prophet stated that among the Prophets he was given a revelation, meaning, he was especially entrusted with the miraculous Qur'an that challenged mankind to produce something similar to it. As for the rest of the divinely revealed Books, they were not miraculous according to many scholars. Allah knows best. The Prophet was also aided with innumerable signs and indications that testify to the truth of his prophethood and what he was sent with, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. </p><h2>Meaning of `Stones</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ النَّارَ الَّتِى وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(Then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers) (2:24). </p><p>`Fuel' is wood, or similar substances, used to start and feed a fire. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا الْقَـسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً </div><p>(And as for the Qasitun (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell) (72:15), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ </div><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you enter it. Had these (idols) been alihah (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein) (21:98-99). </p><p>The stones mentioned here are the giant, rotten, black, sulfuric stones that become the hottest when heated, may Allah save us from this evil end. It was also reported that the stones mentioned here are the idols and rivals that were worshipped instead of Allah, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah,are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:28). </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(prepared for the disbelievers) </p><p>It appears most obvious that it refers to the Fire that is fueled by men and stones, and it also may refer to the stones themselves. There is no contradiction between these two views, because they are dependent upon each other. `Prepared' means, it is `kept' and will surely touch those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger . Ibn Ishaq narrated that Muhammad said that `Ikrimah or Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(prepared for the disbelievers), </p><p>\"For those who embrace the disbelief that you (disbelievers) have embraced.\" </p><h2>Jahannam (Hellfire) exists now</h2><p>Many of the Imams of the Sunnah used this Ayah to prove that the Fire exists now. This is because Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُعِدَّتْ</div><p>(prepared) meaning, prepared and kept. There are many Hadiths on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَحَاجَّتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّار»</div><p>(Paradise and the Fire had an argument..) </p><p>Also, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْتَأْذَنَتِ النَّارُ رَبَّهَا فَقَالَتْ: رَبِّ أَكَلَ بَعضِي بَعْضًا فَأذِنَ لَهَا بِنَفَسَيْنِ: نَفَسٍ فِي الشِّتَاءِ وَنَفَسٍ فِي الصَّيْف»</div><p>(The Fire sought the permission of her Lord. She said, 'O my Lord! Some parts of me consumed the other parts.' And Allah allowed her two periods to exhale, one in winter and one in summer.) </p><p>Also, there is a Hadith recorded from Ibn Mas`ud that the Companions heard the sound of a falling object. When they asked about it, the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هَذَا حَجَرٌ أُلْقِيَ بِهِ مِنْ شَفِيرِ جَهَنَّمَ مُنْذُ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً، الْآنَ وَصَلَ إِلى قَعْرِهَا»</div><p>(This is a stone that was thrown from the top of Jahannam seventy years ago, but only now reached its bottom.) This Hadith is in Sahih Muslim. </p><p>There are many Hadiths that are Mutawatir (narrated by many different chains of narrations) on this subject, such as the Hadiths about the eclipse prayer, the night of Isra' etc. </p><p>Allah's statements, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(Then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof) (2:23), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ</div><p>(A Surah (chapter) like it) (10:38) this includes the short and long Surahs of the Qur'an. Therefore, the challenge to creation stands with regards to both the long and short Surahs, and there is no disagreement that I know of on this fact between the scholars of old and new. Before he became Muslim, `Amr bin Al-`As met Musaylimah the Liar who asked him, \"What has recently been revealed to your fellow (meaning Muhammad ) in Makkah\" `Amr said, \"A short, yet eloquent Surah.\" He asked, \"What is it\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ </div><p>(By Al-`Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss,) (103:1-2) </p><p>Musaylimah thought for a while and said, \"A similar Surah was also revealed to me.\" `Amr asked, \"What is it\" He said, \"O Wabr, O Wabr (i.e. a wild cat), you are but two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is unworthy and thin.\" `Amr said, \"By Allah! You know that I know that you are lying.\" </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Rewards of Righteous Believers</h2><p>After mentioning the torment that Allah has prepared for His miserable enemies who disbelieve in Him and in His Messengers, He mentions the condition of His happy, loyal friends who believe in Him and in His Messengers, adhere to the faith and perform the good deeds. This is the reason why the Qur'an was called Mathani, based on the correct opinion of the scholars. We will elaborate upon this subject later. Mathani means to mention faith and then disbelief, or vice versa. Or, Allah mentions the miserable and then the happy, or vice versa. As for mentioning similar things, it is called Tashabbuh, as we will come to know, Allah willing. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ</div><p>(And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)). Consequently, Allah stated that Paradise has rivers that run beneath it, meaning, underneath its trees and rooms. From Hadiths it is learned that the rivers of Paradise do not run in valleys, and that the banks of Al-Kawthar (the Prophet's lake in Paradise) are made of domes of hollow pearls, the sand of Paradise is made of scented musk while its stones are made from pearls and jewels. We ask Allah to grant Paradise to us, for verily, He is the Most Beneficent, Most Gracious. </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ تَفَجَّرُ تَحْتَ تِلَالٍ أَوْ مِنْ تَحْتِ جِبَالِ الْمِسْك»</div><p>(The rivers of Paradise spring from beneath hills, or mountains of musk.) </p><p>He also reported from Masruq that `Abdullah said, \"The rivers of Paradise spring from beneath mountains of musk.\" </p><h2>The similarity between the Fruits of Paradise</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before\"). </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Yahya bin Abi Kathir said, \"The grass of Paradise is made of saffron, its hills from musk and the boys of everlasting youth will serve the believers with fruits which they will eat. They will then be brought similar fruits, and the people of Paradise will comment, `This is the same as what you have just brought us.' The boys will say to them, `Eat, for the color is the same, but the taste is different. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance). Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that Abu Al-`Aliyah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance) means, \"They look like each other, but the taste is different.\" Also, `Ikrimah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</div><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance) \"They are similar to the fruits of this life, but the fruits of Paradise taste better. \" Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported from Al-A`mash, from Abu Thubyan, that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nothing in Paradise resembles anything in the life of this world, except in name.\" In another narration, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Only the names are similar between what is in this life and what is in Paradise.\" </p><h2>The Wives of the People of Paradise are Pure</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</div><p>(and they shall have therein Azwajun Mutahharatun). Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Purified from filth and impurity.\" Also, Mujahid said, \"From menstruation, relieving the call of nature, urine, spit, semen and pregnancies.\" Also, Qatadah said, \"Purified from impurity and sin.\" In another narration, he said, \"From menstruation and pregnancies.\" Further, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Salih, `Atiyah and As-Suddi were reported to have said similarly. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(and they will abide therein forever) meaning ultimate happiness, for the believers will enjoy everlasting delight, safe from death and disruption of their bliss, for it never ends or ceases. We ask Allah to make us among these believers, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind and Most merciful. </p>"

Allah adds guidance to their guidance, and faith to their faith, because they firmly believe in what they know to be true, that is, the parables that Allah has mentioned. This is guidance that Allah grants them; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلاَّ الْفَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(And He misleads thereby only the Fasiqin (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah)), meaning, the hypocrites. The Arabs say that the date has Fasaqat, when it comes out of its skin, and they call the mouse a Fuwaysiqah, because it leaves its den to cause mischief. The Two Sahihs recorded `A'ishah saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَمْسٌ فَوَاسِقُ يُقْتَلْنَ فِي الْحِلِّ وَالْحَرَمِ: الغُرَابُ وَالْحِدَأَةُ وَالْعَقْرَبُ وَالْفَأْرَةُ وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُور»</div><p>(Five animals are Fawasiq, and they must be killed during Ihram and otherwise: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.) eFasiq, includes the disbeliever and the disobedient. However, the Fisq of the disbeliever is worse, and this is the type of Fasiq that the Ayah is describing here, because Allah described them as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الاٌّرْضِ أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ </div><p>(Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.) </p><p>These are the characteristics of the disbelievers and they contradict the qualities of the believers. Similarly, Allah said in Surat Ar-Ra`d, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ - الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلاَ يِنقُضُونَ الْمِيثَـقَ - وَالَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوءَ الحِسَابِ </div><p>(Shall he then, who knows that what has been revealed unto you (O Muhammad ) from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed. Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the Mithaq (bond, treaty, covenant). And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), and fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning.) (13:19-21)) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ </div><p>(And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).) (13:25) </p><p>The covenant that these deviant people broke is Allah's covenant with His creation, that is, to obey Him and avoid the sins that He prohibited. This covenant was reiterated in Allah's Books and by the words of His Messengers. Ignoring this covenant constitutes breaking it. It was said that the Ayah (2:27) is about the disbelievers and the hypocrites among the People of the Book. In this case, the covenant that they broke is the pledge that Allah took from them in the Tawrah to follow Muhammad when he is sent as a Prophet, and to believe in him, and in what he was sent with. Breaking Allah's covenant in this case occured when the People of the Book rejected the Prophet after they knew the truth about him, and they hid this truth from people, even though they swore to Allah that they would do otherwise. Allah informed us that they threw the covenant behind their backs and sold it for a miserable price. </p><p>It was also reported that the Ayah (2:27) refers to all disbelievers, idol worshippers and hypocrites. Allah took their pledge to believe in His Oneness, showing them the signs that testify to His Lordship. He also took a covenant from them to obey His commands and refrain from His prohibitions, knowing that His Messengers would bring proofs and miracles that none among the creation could ever produce. These miracles testified to the truth of Allah's Messengers. The covenant was broken when the disbelievers denied what was proven to them to be authentic and rejected Allah's Prophets and Books, although they knew that they were the truth. This Tafsir was reported from Muqatil bin Hayyan, and it is very good. It is also the view that Az-Zamakhshari held. </p><p>Allah's statement next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ</div><p>(And sever what Allah has ordered to be joined) is in reference to keeping the relations with the relatives, as Qatadah asserted. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ أَن تُفْسِدُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَتُقَطِّعُواْ أَرْحَامَكُمْ </div><p>(Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship) (47:22) </p><p>Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred this opinion. However, it has been said that the meaning of the Ayah (2:27) here is more general. Hence, everything that Allah has commanded to nurture, and the people severed, is included in its meaning. </p><h2>The Meaning of `Loss</h2><p>Muqatil bin Hayyan commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</div><p>(It is they who are the losers) \"In the Hereafter.\" Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ</div><p>(On them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell)) (13:25). </p><p>Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every characteristic that Allah describes those other than the people of Islam - such as being losers - then it refers to disbelief. However, when they are attributed to the people of Islam, then these terms refer to sin.\" Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</div><p>(It is they who are the losers,) \"`Losers is plural for loser, this word refers to whoever decreased his own share of Allah's mercy by disobeying Him, just as the merchant loses in his trade by sustaining capital loss. Such is the case with the hypocrite and the disbeliever who lose their share of the mercy that Allah has in store for His servants on the Day of Resurrection. And that is when the disbeliever and the hypocrite most desperately need Allah's mercy.\" </p>"

However, the Fisq of the disbeliever is worse, and this is the type of Fasiq that the Ayah is describing here, because Allah described them as, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الاٌّرْضِ أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ </div><p>(Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.) </p><p>These are the characteristics of the disbelievers and they contradict the qualities of the believers. Similarly, Allah said in Surat Ar-Ra`d, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَى إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ - الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلاَ يِنقُضُونَ الْمِيثَـقَ - وَالَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوءَ الحِسَابِ </div><p>(Shall he then, who knows that what has been revealed unto you (O Muhammad ) from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed. Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the Mithaq (bond, treaty, covenant). And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), and fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning.) (13:19-21)) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَـقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ </div><p>(And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).) (13:25) </p><p>The covenant that these deviant people broke is Allah's covenant with His creation, that is, to obey Him and avoid the sins that He prohibited. This covenant was reiterated in Allah's Books and by the words of His Messengers. Ignoring this covenant constitutes breaking it. It was said that the Ayah (2:27) is about the disbelievers and the hypocrites among the People of the Book. In this case, the covenant that they broke is the pledge that Allah took from them in the Tawrah to follow Muhammad when he is sent as a Prophet, and to believe in him, and in what he was sent with. Breaking Allah's covenant in this case occured when the People of the Book rejected the Prophet after they knew the truth about him, and they hid this truth from people, even though they swore to Allah that they would do otherwise. Allah informed us that they threw the covenant behind their backs and sold it for a miserable price. </p><p>It was also reported that the Ayah (2:27) refers to all disbelievers, idol worshippers and hypocrites. Allah took their pledge to believe in His Oneness, showing them the signs that testify to His Lordship. He also took a covenant from them to obey His commands and refrain from His prohibitions, knowing that His Messengers would bring proofs and miracles that none among the creation could ever produce. These miracles testified to the truth of Allah's Messengers. The covenant was broken when the disbelievers denied what was proven to them to be authentic and rejected Allah's Prophets and Books, although they knew that they were the truth. This Tafsir was reported from Muqatil bin Hayyan, and it is very good. It is also the view that Az-Zamakhshari held. </p><p>Allah's statement next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ</div><p>(And sever what Allah has ordered to be joined) is in reference to keeping the relations with the relatives, as Qatadah asserted. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ أَن تُفْسِدُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَتُقَطِّعُواْ أَرْحَامَكُمْ </div><p>(Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship) (47:22) </p><p>Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred this opinion. However, it has been said that the meaning of the Ayah (2:27) here is more general. Hence, everything that Allah has commanded to nurture, and the people severed, is included in its meaning. </p><h2>The Meaning of `Loss</h2><p>Muqatil bin Hayyan commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</div><p>(It is they who are the losers) \"In the Hereafter.\" Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ</div><p>(On them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell)) (13:25). </p><p>Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every characteristic that Allah describes those other than the people of Islam - such as being losers - then it refers to disbelief. However, when they are attributed to the people of Islam, then these terms refer to sin.\" Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</div><p>(It is they who are the losers,) \"`Losers is plural for loser, this word refers to whoever decreased his own share of Allah's mercy by disobeying Him, just as the merchant loses in his trade by sustaining capital loss. Such is the case with the hypocrite and the disbeliever who lose their share of the mercy that Allah has in store for His servants on the Day of Resurrection. And that is when the disbeliever and the hypocrite most desperately need Allah's mercy.\" </p>"

He placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers) in four Days equal (i.e. all these four `days' were equal in the length of time) for all those who ask (about its creation). Then He Istawa ila the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: \"Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.\" They both said: \"We come willingly.\" Then He finished them (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower) (41:9-12). </p><p>These Ayat indicate that Allah started creation by creating earth, then He made heaven into seven heavens. This is how building usually starts, with the lower floors first and then the top floors, as the scholars of Tafsir reiterated, as we will come to know, Allah willing. Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَنَـهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا - وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا - مَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ </div><p>(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed He raised its height, and has perfected it.

And the mountains He has fixed firmly. (To be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle) (79:27-33). </p><p>It is said that \"Then\" in the Ayah (2:29) relates only to the order of reciting the information being given, it does not relate to the order that the events being mentioned took place, this was reported from Ibn `Abbas by `Ali bin Abi Talhah. </p><h2>The Earth was created before Heaven</h2><p>Mujahid commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ لَكُم مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً</div><p>(He it is Who created for you all that is on earth) \"Allah created the earth before heaven, and when He created the earth, smoke burst out of it.

Several Tafsir scholars of old and recent times also said similarly, as we have elaborated on in the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at (chapter 79). The result of that discussion is that the word Daha (translated above as \"spread\") is mentioned and explained in Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا </div><p>(And the earth, after that, He spread it out. And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly.) (79:30-32) </p><p>Therefore, Daha means that the earth's treasures were brought to its surface after finishing the job of creating whatever will reside on earth and heaven. When the earth became Daha, the water burst out to its surface and the various types, colors, shapes and kinds of plants grew. The stars started rotating along with the planets that rotate around them. And Allah knows best. </p>"

Mention to your people what Allah said to the angels, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِى الأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً</div><p>(Verily, I am going to place a Khalifah on earth). </p><p>Meaning people reproducing generation after generation, century after century, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَـئِفَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And it is He Who has made you (Khala'if) generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth) (6:165), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ حُلَفَآءَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And makes you (Khulafa') inheritors of the earth) (27:62), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ </div><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have (destroyed you (mankind all, and) made angels to replace you (Yakhlufun) on the earth.) (43: 60) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ</div><p>(Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation (Khalf)) (7:169). It appears that Allah was not refering to Adam specifically as Khalifah, otherwise he would not have allowed the angels' statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَآءَ</div><p>(Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood). </p><p>The angels meant that this type of creature usually commits the atrocities they mentioned. The angels knew of this fact, according to their understanding of human nature, for Allah stated that He would create man from clay. Or, the angels understood this fact from the word Khalifah, which also means the person who judges disputes that occur between people, forbidding them from injustice and sin, as Al-Qurtubi said. </p><p>The statement the angels uttered was not a form of disputing with Allah's, nor out of envy for the Children of Adam, as some mistakenly thought. Allah has described them as those who do not precede Him in speaking, meaning that they do not ask Allah anything without His permission. When Allah informed them that He was going to create a creation on the earth, and they had knowledge that this creation would commit mischief on it, as Qatadah mentioned, they said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَآءَ</div><p>(Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood) </p><p>This is only a question for the sake of learning about the wisdom of that, as if they said, Our Lord! What is the wisdom of creating such creatures since they will cause trouble in the earth and spill blood \"If the wisdom behind this action is that You be worshipped, we praise and glorify You (meaning we pray to You) we never indulge in mischief, so why create other creatures\" </p><p>Allah said to the angels in answer to their inquiry, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(I know that which you do not know.) meaning, \"I know that the benefit of creating this type of creature outweighs the harm that you mentioned, that which you have no knowledge of. I will create among them Prophets and send Messengers. I will also create among them truthful, martyrs, righteous believers, worshippers, the modest, the pious, the scholars who implement their knowledge, humble people and those who love Allah and follow His Messengers.\" </p><p>The Sahih recorded that when the angels ascend to Allah with the records of the servant's deeds, Allah asks them, while having better knowledge, \"How did you leave My servants\" They will say, \"We came to them while they were praying and left them while they were praying.\" This is because the angels work in shifts with mankind, and they change shifts during the Fajr and `Asr prayers. The angels who descended will remain with us, while the angels who have remained with us ascend with our deeds. The Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُرْفَعُ إِلَيْهِ عَمَلُ اللَّيْلِ قَبْلَ النَّهَارِ وَعَمَلُ النَّهَارِ قَبْلَ اللَّيْل»</div><p>(The deeds of the night are elevated to Allah before the morning, and the deeds of the morning before the night falls. ) </p><p>Hence, the angels' statement, \"We came to them while they were praying and left them while they were praying,\" explains Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(I know that which you do not know.) </p><p>It was said that the meaning of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(I know that which you do not know.) is, \"I have a specific wisdom in creating them, which you do not have knowledge of.\" It was also said that it is in answer to, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ</div><p>(While we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You) after which Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(I know that which you do not know). Meaning, \"I know that Iblis is not as you are, although he is among you.\" Others said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَآءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ</div><p>\"(Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, ـ while we glorify you with praises and thanks and sanctify You.) is their request that they should be allowed to inhabit the earth, instead of the Children of Adam. So Allah said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(I know that which you do not know) if your inhabiting the heavens is better, or worse for you.\" Ar-Razi as well as others said this. Allah knows best. </p><h2>The Obligation of appointing a Khalifah and some related Issues</h2><p>Al-Qurtubi, as well as other scholars, said that this Ayah (2:30) proves the obligation of appointing a Khalifah to pass judgements on matters of dispute between people, to aid the oppressed against the oppressor, to implement the Islamic penal code and to forbid evil. There are many other tasks that can only be fulfilled by appointing the Imam, and what is necessary in performing an obligation, is an obligation itself. We should state here that Imamah occurs by either naming a successor, as a group among Ahl As-Sunnah scholars said occurred - by the Prophet - in the case of Abu Bakr, or hinting to a successor. Or, the current Khalifah names a certain person as Khalifah after him, as Abu Bakr did with `Umar. Or, the Khalifah might leave the matter in the hands of the Muslim consultative council, or a group of righteous men, just as `Umar did. Or, the people of authority could gather around a certain person to whom they give the pledge of allegiance, or they could select one among them to choose the candidate, according to the majority of the scholars. </p><p>The Khalifah must be a responsible adult Muslim male, able to perform Ijtihad (independent legal judgments), bodily able, righteous, with knowledge of warfare, politics. He also must be from the tribe of Quraysh, according to the correct view, but it is not necessary that he be from the tribe of Bani Hashim, or that he be immune from error, as the Rafidah (Shiites) falsely claim. </p><p>When the Khalifah becomes an immoral person (Fasiq), should he be impeached There is disagreement over this matter, but the correct view is that he is not to be removed, because the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِلَّا أَنْ تَرَوْا كُفْرًا بَوَاحًا عِنْدَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ فِيهِ بُرْهَان»</div><p>(Unless you witness a clear Kufr regarding which you have clear proof from Allah. ) </p><p>Does the Khalifah have the right to resign from his post There is a difference on this issue. It is a fact that Al-Hasan bin `Ali removed himself from the position of Khalifah and surrendered it to Mu`awiyah. However, this occurred because of a necessity, and Al-Hasan was praised for this action. </p><p>It is not permissible to appoint two Imams for the world or more at the same time. This is not allowed because the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ جَاءَكُمْ وَأَمْرُكُمْ جَمِيعٌ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُفَرِّقَ بَيْنَكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُ كَائِنًا مَنْ كَان»</div><p>(Whoever came to you while you are united and tried to divide you, then execute him, no matter who he is.) </p><p>This is the view of the majority of scholars. Imam Al-Haramayn stated that Abu Ishaq allowed the appointment of two or more Imams when the various provinces are far away from each other. However, Imam Al-Haramayn himself was indecisive about this view. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Virtue of Adam over the Angels</h2><p>Allah stated the virtue of Adam above the angels, because He taught Adam, rather than them, the names of everything. This occurred after they prostrated to him.

This occurred after they prostrated to him. This discussion precedes that event here, only to show the importance of his position, and the absence of the angels' knowledge about creating the Khalifah when they asked about it. So Allah informed the angels that He knows what they do not know, and then He mentioned this to show them Adam's superiority over them in knowledge. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ الأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)). </p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ الأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)) \"Meaning, the names that people use, such as human, animal, sky, earth, land, sea, horse, donkey, and so forth, including the names of the other species.\" Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir reported that `Asim bin Kulayb narrated from Sa`id bin Ma`bad that Ibn `Abbas was questioned, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ الأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</div><p>(And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)) \"Did Allah teach him the names of the plate and the pot\" He said, \"Yes, and even the terms for breaking wind!\" </p><p>Allah taught Adam the names of everything, their proper names, the names of their characteristics, and what they do, just as Ibn `Abbas stated about the terms for passing gas. </p><p>In his Sahih, Al-Bukhari explained this Ayah in the Book of Tafsir with a report from Anas bin Malik who said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجْتَمِعُ الْمُؤمِنُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَقُولُونَ: لَوِ اسْتَشْفَعْنَا إِلَى رَبِّنَا فَيَأْتُونَ آدَمَ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَنْتَ أَبُو النَّاسِ خَلَقَكَ اللهُ بِيَدِهِ وَأَسْجَدَ لَكَ مَلَائِكَتَهُ وَعَلَّمَكَ أَسْمَاءَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، فَاشْفَعْ لَنَا عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ حَتَّى يُريحَنَا مِنْ مَكَانِنَا هَذا، فَيَقُولُ: لَسْتُ هُنَاكُمْ وَيَذْكُرُ ذَنْبَهُ فَيَسْتَحْيِي ائْتُوا نُوحًا فإِنَّهُ أَوَّلُ رَسُولٍ بَعَثَهُ اللهُ إِلَى أَهْلِ الْأَرْضِ، فَيَأْتُونَه، فَيَقُولُ: لَسْتُ هُناكُمْ وَيَذْكُر سُؤَالَه رَبَّه مَا لَيْسَ لَهُ بِه عِلْم فَيَسْتَحْيِي فَيَقُولُ: ائْتُوا خَلِيلَ الرَّحْمن فَيَأْتُونَهُ فَيقُولُ: لَسْتُ هُنَاكُمْ فَيَقُولُ: ائْتُوا مُوسَى عَبْدًا كَلَّمَهُ اللهُ وَأعْطَاهُ التَّوْرَاةَ، فَيقُولُ: لَسْتُ هُنَاكُم فَيَذْكُرُ قَتْلَ النَّفْسِ بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ فَيَسْتَحْيِي مِنْ رَبِّهِ فَيَقُولُ: ائْتُوا عِيسى عَبْدَاللهِ وَرَسُولَهُ وَكَلِمَةَ اللهِ ورُوحَهُ، فَيَأْتُونَهُ فَيَقُولُ: لَسْتُ هُنَاكُمْ ائْتُوا مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّم مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، فَيَأْتُونِّي فأَنْطَلِقُ حَتَّى أَسْتأذِنَ عَلَى رَبِّي فيَأْذَنُ لِي، فإِذَا رأَيْتُ رَبِّي وَقَعْتُ سَاجِدًا فَيَدَعُنِي مَا شَاءَ اللهُ ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ وَسَلْ تُعْطَهْ وَقُلْ يُسْمَعْ وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ، فأَرْفَعُ رَأْسِي فأَحْمَدُهُ بِتَحْمِيدٍ يُعَلِّمُنِيهِ ثُمَّ أَشْفَعُ فَيُحَدُّ لِي حَدًّا فأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ ثُمَّ أَعُودُ إلَيْهِ فَإذَا رَأَيْتُ رَبِّي مِثْلَهُ ثُمَّ أَشْفَعُ فَيُحَدُّ لِي حدًّا فأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ ثُمَّ أَعُودُ الثَّالِثَةَ ثُمَّ أعُودُ الرَّابِعَةَ فَأَقُولُ:مَا بَقِيَ فِي النَّار إلَّا مَنْ حَبَسَهُ الْقُرْآنُ وَوَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْخُلُود»</div><p>(The believers will gather on the Day of Resurrection and will say, `We should seek a means of intercession with our Lord' They will go to Adam and say, `O Adam!

Will you not intercede for us with your Lord, so that he relieve us from this gathering place' On that Adam will reply, `I cannot do what you have asked'. He will have remembered his error and will be embarrassed, saying, `Go to Nuh, for he is the first of Allah's Messengers whom Allah sent to the people of the earth.' They will go to Nuh and ask him. He will say, `I cannot do what you have asked.' He will recall asking Allah what he was not to know, and will also be embarrassed. He will say, `Go to Khalil Ar-Rahman.' They will go to Ibrahim and he will also say, `I cannot do what you have asked.' He will say, `Go to Musa, a servant to whom Allah spoke directly and gave the Tawrah.' Musa will say, `I cannot do what you have asked.' He will remember that he killed a person without justification and will be embarrassed before his Lord. He will say, `Go to `Isa, Allah's servant and Messenger and His Word and a spirit of His.' They will go to `Isa and he will say, `I will not do what you asked. Go to Muhammad, a servant whose previous and latter errors were forgiven.' They will come to me, and I will go to Allah and seek His permission and He will give me His permission. When I gaze at my Lord, I will prostrate myself and Allah will allow me to remain like that as much as He will. Then I will be addressed, `O Muhammad! Raise your head; ask, for you will be given what you ask, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will raise my head and thank and praise Allah with such praise as He will inspire me. I will intercede and He will grant me a quantity of people that He will admit into Paradise. I will go back to Him, and when I see my Lord, I will intercede and He will allow me a quantity that He will admit into Paradise. I will do that for a third and then a fourth time. I will say, `There are no more people left in Hell except those whom the Qur'an has incarcerated and have thus acquired eternity in Hell.') This Hadith was collected by Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. fThe reason why we mentioned this Hadith here is the Prophet's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَيَأْتُونَ آدَمَ فَيَقُولُون: أنْتَ أَبُو النَّاسِ خَلَقَكَ اللهُ بِيَدِهِ وَأَسْجَدَ لَكَ مَلَائِكَتَهُ وَعَلَّمَكَ أَسْمَاءَ كُلِّ شَيْء»</div><p>(They will go to Adam and say, `O Adam! You are the father of all mankind, and Allah created you with His Own Hand, ordered the angels to prostrate for you, and taught you the names of everything). This part of the Hadith testifies to the fact that Allah taught Adam the names of all creatures. </p><p>This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى الْمَلَـئِكَةِ</div><p>(Then He showed them to the angels) meaning, the objects or creations. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said, \"Allah paraded the objects before the angels, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالَ أَنبِئُونِى بِأَسْمَآءِ هَـؤُلاَءِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(And said, \"Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful\").\" </p><p>Allah's statement means, \"Tell Me the names of what I paraded before you, O angels who said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَآءَ</div><p>(Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood). </p><p>You asked, `Are You appointing a Khalifah from us or from other creations We praise and glorify You. </p><p>Therefore, Allah said, \"If you say the truth, that if I appoint a non-angel Khalifah on the earth, he and his offspring will disobey Me, commit mischief and shed blood, but if I designate you the Khalifahs you will obey Me, follow My command and honor and glorify Me. However, since you do not know the names of the objects I paraded before you, then you have even less knowledge of what will occur on the earth that does not exist yet.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَكَ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ </div><p>(They (angels) said: \"Glory is to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the Knower, the Wise.\"). </p><p>Here the angels are praising Allah's holiness, and perfection above every kind of deficiency, affirming that no creature could ever acquire any part of Allah's knowledge, except by His permission, nor could anyone know anything except what Allah teaches them. This is why they said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَكَ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ</div><p>(\"Glory is to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily You are the Knower, the Wise) meaning, Allah is knowledgeable of everything, Most Wise about His creation, and He makes the wisest decisions, and He teaches and deprives whom He wills from knowledge. Verily, Allah's wisdom and justice in all matters is perfect. </p><h2>Adam's Virtue of Knowledge is demonstrated</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يَـاءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ فَلَمَّآ أَنبَأَهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِم قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُل لَّكُمْ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ السَّمَـوَاتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ </div><p>(He said: \"O Adam!

      "text": "<h2>Honoring Adam when the Angels prostrated before Him</h2><p>This Ayah mentions the great honor that Allah granted Adam, and Allah reminded Adam's offspring of this fact. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, as this Ayah and many Hadiths testify, such as the Hadith about the intercession that we discussed. There is a Hadith about the supplication of Musa, \"O my Lord! Show me Adam who caused us and himself to be thrown out of Paradise.\" When Musa met Adam, he said to him, \"Are you Adam whom Allah created with His Own Hands, blew life into and commanded the angels to prostrate before\" Iblis was among Those ordered to prostrate before Adam, although He was not an Angel </p><p>When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis was included in this command. Although Iblis was not an angel, he was trying - and pretending - to imitate the angels' behavior and deeds, and this is why he was also included in the command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. Satan was criticized for defying that command, as we will explain with detail, Allah willing, when we mention the Tafsir of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِ</div><p>(Except Iblis (Satan). He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord.) (18:50) </p><p>Similarly, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Before he undertook the path of sin, Iblis was with the angels and was called `Azazil.' He was among the residents of the earth and was one of the most active worshippers and knowledgeable persons among the angels. This fact caused him to be arrogant. Iblis was from a genus called Jinn.\" </p><h2>The Prostration was before Adam but the Obedience was to Allah</h2><p>Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</div><p>(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\") </p><p>\"The obedience was for Allah and the prostration was before Adam. Allah honored Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him.\" Some people said that this prostration was just a prostration of greeting, peace and honor, hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّواْ لَهُ سُجَّدَا وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّا</div><p>(And he (Prophet Yusuf) raised his parents to the throne and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: \"O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true!\") (12:100) </p><p>The practice of prostrating was allowed for previous nations, but was repealed for ours. Mu`adh said to the Prophet , \"I visited Ash-Sham and found that they used to prostate before their priests and scholars. You, O Messenger of Allah, are more deserving of prostration.\" The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا لَوْ كُنْتُ آمِرًا بَشَرًا أنْ يَسْجُدَ لِبَشَرٍ لَأَمَرْتُ الْمَرْأةَ أنْ تَسْجُدَ لِزَوجِهَا مِنْ عِظَمِ حَقِّهِ عَلَيْهَا»</div><p>(No. If I was to command any human to prostrate before another human, I would command the wife to prostrate before her husband because of the enormity of his right on her.) </p><p>Ar-Razi agreed with this view. Also, Qatadah said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى وَاسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(And they prostrated except Iblis (Shaytan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).) </p><p>\"Iblis, the enemy of Allah, envied Adam because Allah honored Adam.

      "text": "<h2>Adam was honored again</h2><p>Allah honored Adam by commanding the angels to prostrate before him, so they all complied except for Iblis. Allah then allowed Adam to live and eat wherever and whatever he wished in Paradise. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Dharr saying, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Was Adam a Prophet' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ نَبِيًّا رَسُولًا كَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ قُبُلًا»</div><p>(Yes. He was a Prophet and a Messenger to whom Allah spoke directly), meaning </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>((O Adam!) Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise.)\" </p><h2>Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise</h2><p>The Ayah (2:35) indicates that Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise, as Muhammad bin Ishaq stated. Ibn Ishaq said, \"After Allah finished criticizing Iblis, and after teaching Adam the names of everything, He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـاءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ</div><p>(O Adam!

Allah then created Adam's wife, Hawwa', from his rib and made her a woman, so that she could be a comfort for him. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa' next to him, it was claimed, he said, `My flesh and blood, my wife.' Hence, Adam reclined with Hawwa'. When Allah married Adam to Hawwa' and gave him comfort, Allah said to him directly, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَاءَادَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الْظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(\"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin (wrongdoers).\").\" </p><h2>Allah tests Adam</h2><p>Allah's statement to Adam, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ</div><p>(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Some said that it was the grape tree, barley, date tree, fig tree, and so forth. Some said that it was a certain tree, and whoever eats from it will be relieved of the call of nature. It was also said that it was a tree from which the angels eat so that they live for eternity. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. It is possible that it was one of those trees. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.\" This is similar to what Ar-Razi stated in his Tafsir, and this is the correct opinion.

      "text": "<h2>Adam was honored again</h2><p>Allah honored Adam by commanding the angels to prostrate before him, so they all complied except for Iblis. Allah then allowed Adam to live and eat wherever and whatever he wished in Paradise. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Dharr saying, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Was Adam a Prophet' He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَعَمْ نَبِيًّا رَسُولًا كَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ قُبُلًا»</div><p>(Yes. He was a Prophet and a Messenger to whom Allah spoke directly), meaning </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>((O Adam!) Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise.)\" </p><h2>Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise</h2><p>The Ayah (2:35) indicates that Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise, as Muhammad bin Ishaq stated. Ibn Ishaq said, \"After Allah finished criticizing Iblis, and after teaching Adam the names of everything, He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـاءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ</div><p>(O Adam! Inform them of their names) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ</div><p>(Verily, You are the Knower, the Wise.) </p><p>Then Adam fell asleep, as the People of the Book and other scholars such as Ibn `Abbas have stated, Allah took one of Adam's left ribs and made flesh grow in its place, while Adam was asleep and unaware. Allah then created Adam's wife, Hawwa', from his rib and made her a woman, so that she could be a comfort for him. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa' next to him, it was claimed, he said, `My flesh and blood, my wife.' Hence, Adam reclined with Hawwa'. When Allah married Adam to Hawwa' and gave him comfort, Allah said to him directly, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَاءَادَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الْظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(\"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin (wrongdoers).\").\" </p><h2>Allah tests Adam</h2><p>Allah's statement to Adam, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ</div><p>(but come not near this tree) is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Some said that it was the grape tree, barley, date tree, fig tree, and so forth. Some said that it was a certain tree, and whoever eats from it will be relieved of the call of nature. It was also said that it was a tree from which the angels eat so that they live for eternity. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. It is possible that it was one of those trees. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.\" This is similar to what Ar-Razi stated in his Tafsir, and this is the correct opinion. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَـنُ عَنْهَا</div><p>(Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom) either refers to Paradise, and in this case, it means that Shaytan led Adam and Hawwa' away from it, as `Asim bin Abi An-Najud recited it.

We should state that Allah is not criticizing the People of the Book for ordering righteousness, because enjoining good is a part of righteousness and is an obligation for the scholars.

And my guidance cannot come except from Allah, in Him I trust and unto Him I repent) (11:88). </p><p>Therefore, enjoining righteousness and performing righteousness are both required. Neither category is rendered not necessary by the practice of the other, according to the most correct view of the scholars among the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Wa'il said, \"While I was riding behind Usamah, he was asked, `Why not advise `Uthman' He said, `Do you think that if I advise him I should allow you to hear it I advise him in secret, and I will not start something that I would hate to be the first to start. I will not say to a man, `You are the best man,' even if he was my leader, after what I heard from the Messenger of Allah .' They said, `What did he say' He said, `I heard him say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُجَاءُ بِالرَّجُلِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامةِ فَيُلْقَى فِي النَّار فَتَنْدَلِقُ بِه أَقْتَابُهُ فيَدُورُ بِهَا فِي النَّار كَمَا يَدُورُ الْحِمَارُ بِرَحَاهُ فيُطِيفُ بِهِ أَهْلُ النَّار فَيَقُولُون: يَا فُلَانُ ما أَصَابَكَ؟ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ تَأْمُرُنَا بِالْمَعْرُوف وَتَنْهَانَا عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: كُنْتُ آمرُكُمْ باِلْمَعْرُوفِ وَلَا آتِيهِ وَأَنْهَاكُمْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَآتِيه»</div><p>(A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the Fire. His intestines will fall out and he will continue circling pulling them behind him, just as the donkey goes around the pole. The people of the Fire will go to that man and ask him, `What happened to you Did you not used to command us to do righteous acts and forbid us from committing evil' He will say, `Yes. I used to enjoin righteousness, but refrained from performing righteousness, and I used to forbid you to perform from evil while I myself did it.').\"' </p><p>This Hadith was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. eAlso, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"I hesitate in advising people because of three Ayat: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبِرِّ وَتَنسَوْنَ أَنفُسَكُمْ</div><p>(Enjoin you Al-Birr on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ - كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ اللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ </div><p>(O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do Most hateful it is to Allah that you say that which you do not do) (61:2-3).\" </p><p>And Allah informed us that the Prophet Shu`ayb said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ الإِصْلَـحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ وَمَا تَوْفِيقِى إِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ</div><p>(I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you. I only desire reform to the best of my power. And my guidance cannot come except from Allah, in Him I trust and unto Him I repent) (11:88). </p>"

Allah's statement next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ</div><p>(nor will they be helped.) means, \"no person shall get angry - or anxious - on their behalf and offer them any help, or try to save them from Allah's punishment.\" As stated earlier on that Day, neither the relative, nor persons of authority will feel pity for the disbelievers, nor will any ransom be accepted for them. Consequently, they will receive no help from others and they will be helpless themsleves. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ يُجْيِرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(While He (Allah) grants refuge (or protection), but none grants refuge from Him) (23:88) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ يُعَذِّبُ عَذَابَهُ أَحَدٌ - وَلاَ يُوثِقُ وَثَاقَهُ أَحَدٌ </div><p>(So on that Day none will punish as He will punish. And none will bind (the wicked, disbelievers and polytheists) as He will bind) (89:25-26) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنَـصَرُونَ - بَلْ هُمُ الْيَوْمَ مُسْتَسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(\"What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)\" Nay, but that Day they shall surrender) (37:25-26) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلاَ نَصَرَهُمُ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قُرْبَاناً ءَالِهَةَ بَلْ ضَلُّواْ عَنْهُمْ</div><p>(Then why did those whom they had taken for alihah (gods) besides Allah, as a way of approach (to Allah) not help them Nay, but they vanished completely from them) (46:28). </p><p>Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنَـصَرُونَ </div><p>(\"What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another\") (37:25) means, \"This Day, you shall not have a refuge from Us. Not this Day.\" Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ</div><p>(nor will they be helped.) meaning, on that Day, they shall neither be helped by any helper, nor shall anyone intercede on their behalf. No repeal or ransom will be accepted for them, all courtesy towards them will have ceased, along with any helpful intercession. No type of help or cooperation will be available for them on that Day. The judgment will, on that Day, be up to the Most Great, the Most Just, against whom no intercessor or helper can ever assist. He will then award the evil deed its kind and will multiply the good deeds. This is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ مَّسْئُولُونَ - مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنَـصَرُونَ - بَلْ هُمُ الْيَوْمَ مُسْتَسْلِمُونَ </div><p>(But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned. \"What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another\" Nay, but that Day they shall surrender) (37:24-26). </p>"

This favor came after the cursed Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw a fire emerge from Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and then the fire entered the houses of the Coptics in Egypt, with the exception of the Children of Israel. Its purport was that his kingship would be toppled by a man among the Children of Israel. It was also said that some of Pharaoh's entourage said that the Children of Israel were expecting a man among them to arise who would establish a state for them. We will mention the Hadith on this subject when we explain Surat Ta Ha (20), Allah willing. After the dream, Pharaoh ordered that every newborn male among the Children of Israel be killed and that the girls be left alone. He also commanded that the Children of Israel be given tasks of hard labor and assigned the most humiliating jobs. </p><p>The torment here refers to killing the male infants.

      "text": "<h2>The Shade, the Manna and the Quail</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the calamities that He saved the Children of Israel from, He mentioned the favors that He granted them, saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ</div><p>And We shaded you with clouds. This A0yah mentions the white clouds that provided shade for the Children of Israel, protecting them from the sun s heat during their years of wandering. In the Hadith about the trials, An-Nasa0 i recorded Ibn Abba0s saying, Allah shaded the Children of Israel with clouds during the years of wandering. Ibn Abi Hلa0tim said, Narrations similar to that of Ibn Abba0s were reported from Ibn Umar, Ar-Rab0 bin Anas, Abu Mijlaz, Adل-Dلahلhلa0k, and As-Suddi. Al-Hلasan and Qata0dah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ</div><p>(And We shaded you with clouds) \"This happened when they were in the desert and the clouds shielded them from the sun.\" Ibn Jarir said that several scholars said that the type of cloud the Ayah mentioned, \"was cooler and better than the type we know.\" </p><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ</div><p>And sent down on you Al-Manna, The manna used to descend to them to the trees, and they used to eat whatever they wished of it. Also, Qata0dah said, The manna, which was whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, used to rain down on the Children of Israel, just as the snow falls, from dawn until sunrise. One of them would collect enough for that particular day, for if it remained more than that, it would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, one would collect enough for the sixth and the seventh day, which was the Sabbath during which one would not leave home to seek his livelihood, or for anything else. All this occurred in the wilderness. The type of manna that we know provides sufficient food when eaten alone, because it is nutritious and sweet. When manna is mixed with water, it becomes a sweet drink. It also changes composition when mixed with other types of food. However, this is not the only type. The evidence to this fact is that Al-Bukha0ri narrated, that Sa 0d bin Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن»</div><p>(Kam'ah (truffles) is a type of manna, and its liquid is a remedy for the eyes.) </p><p>This Hadith was also collected by Imam Ahmad. The group of Hadith compilers, with the exception of Abu Dawud, also collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Sahih. At-Tirmidhi recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْعَجْوَةُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَفِيهَا شِفَاءٌ مِنَ السُّمِّ وَالْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن»</div><p>(The `Ajwah (pressed, dried date) is from Paradise and it cures poison, Al-Kam'ah (truffles) is a form of manna, and its liquid heals the eye.\") At-Tirmidhi is the only one of them who recorded this Hadith. </p><p>As for the quail (Salwa) in question, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The (Salwa) is a bird that looks like the quail.\" This is the same opinion reported from Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, may Allah have mercy upon them. Also, `Ikrimah said that the Salwa is a bird in Paradise about the size of a sparrow. Qatadah said \"The Salwa is a bird that is similar to a sparrow. During that time, an Israelite could catch as many quails as was sufficient for that particular day, otherwise the meat would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, he would collect what is enough for the sixth and the seventh day, the Sabbath, during which one was not allowed to depart his home to seek anything.\" </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَـتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ</div><p>(Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you,) (7:160) this form of command is a simple order of allowance, guiding to what is good. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ</div><p>(And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves) means, `We commanded them to eat from what We gave them, and to perform the acts of worship (but they rebelled).' This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُواْ لَهُ</div><p>(Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him) (34:15). </p><p>Yet, the Children of Israel rebelled, disbelieved and committed injustice against themselves, even though they saw the clear signs, tremendous miracles and extraordinary events. </p><h2>The Virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the Companions of all Other Prophets</h2><p>Here it is important to point out the virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the companions of the other Prophets. This includes firmness in the religion, patience and the lack of arrogance, may Allah be pleased with them. Although the Companions accompanied the Prophet in his travels and battles, such as during the battle of Tabuk, in intense heat and hardship, they did not ask for a miracle, though this was easy for the Prophet by Allah's leave. And when the Companions became hungry, they merely asked the Prophet - to invoke Allah - for an increase in the amount of food. They collected whatever food they had and brought it to the Prophet , and he asked Allah to bless it, told each of them to take some food, and they filled every pot they had. Also, when they needed rain, the Prophet asked Allah to send down rain, and a rain cloud came. They drank, gave water to their camels and filled their water skins. When they looked around, they found that the cloud had only rained on their camp. This is the best example of those who were willing to accept Allah's decision and follow the Messenger of Allah . </p>"

They were also commanded to fight the disbelieving `Amaliq (Canaanites) dwelling in the holy land at that time. But they did not want to fight, because they were weak and exhausted. Allah punished them by causing them to become lost, and to continue wandering, as Allah has stated in Surat Al-Ma'idah (5). The correct opinion about the meaning of, `the holy land' mentioned here is that it was Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), as As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Abu Muslim Al-Asfahani, as well as others have stated. Musa said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَاقَوْمِ ادْخُلُوا الاٌّرْضَ المُقَدَّسَةَ الَّتِى كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَرْتَدُّوا</div><p>(O people!

Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَادْخُلُواْ الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا</div><p>(and enter the gate Sujjadan) means, \"While bowing\".

It was also said that the Sujud mentioned here means, `submissiveness', for actually entering while prostrating is not possible. </p><p>Khasif said that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The door mentioned here was facing the Qiblah.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said that the door is the door of Hittah in Iylya', which is Jerusalem. Ar-Razi also reported that some of them said that it was a door in the direction of the Qiblah\". Khasif said that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Children of Israel entered the door sideways. As-Suddi said that Abu Sa`id Al-Azdy said that Abu Al-Kanud said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that they were commanded to, u </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَادْخُلُواْ الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا</div><p>(enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with humility)) but instead, they entered while their heads were raised in defiance. </p><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُولُواْ حِطَّةٌ</div><p>(and say: `Hittah'). Ibn `Abbas commented, \"Seek Allah's forgiveness.\" Al-Hasan and Qatadah said that it means, \"Say, `Relieve us from our errors.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَـيَـكُمْ وَسَنَزِيدُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</div><p>(and We shall forgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers) Here is the reward for fulfilling Allah's commandment. This Ayah means, \"If you implement what We commanded you, We will forgive your sins and multiply your good deeds.\" In summary, upon achieving victory, the Children of Israel were commanded to submit to Allah in tongue and deed and, to admit to their sins and seek forgiveness for them, to be grateful to Allah for the blessings He gave them, hastening to do the deeds that Allah loves, as He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ - وَرَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ اللَّهِ أَفْوَجاً - فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوِبَا </div><p>(When there comes the help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah). And you see that the people enter Allah's religion (Islam) in crowds. So glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance.) (110). </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ الَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ</div><p>(But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another). </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قِيلَ لِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا وَقُولُوا: حِطَّةٌ، فَدَخَلُوا يَزْحَفُون عَلى أَسْتَاهِهِم فَبَدَّلُوا وَقَالُوا، حَبَّةٌ فِي شَعْرَة»</div><p>(The Children of Israel were commanded to enter the door while bowing and to say `Hittah'. Yet, they entered the door on their behinds, distorting the words. They said; `Habbah (seed), in Sha`rah (a hair).') </p><p>An-Nasa'i recorded this part of it from Abu Hurayrah only, but he has a chain from the Prophet , explaining Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حِطَّةٌ</div><p>(`Hittah'), saying, \"So they deviated and said `Habbah.\" Similar was recorded by `Abdur-Razzaq, and his route was also collected by Al-Bukhari. Muslim and At-Tirmidhi narrated similar versions of this Hadith, At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" </p><p>The summary of what the scholars have said about this subject is that the Children of Israel distorted Allah's command to them to submit to Him in tongue and deed. They were commanded to enter the city while bowing down, but they entered while sliding on their rear ends and raising their heads! They were commanded to say, `Hittah' meaning, \"Relieve us from our errors and sins.\" However, they mocked this command and said, \"Hintah (grain seed) in Sha`irah (barley).\" This demonstrates the worst type of rebellion and disobedience, and it is why Allah released His anger and punishment upon them, all because of their sinning and defying His commands. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزًا مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ</div><p>(So We sent upon the wrongdoers Rijz (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebellion.) </p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every word in Allah's Book that says Rijz means, `a punishment.\"' Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan and Qatadah were reported to have said that Rijz means `Torment.' Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Sa`d bin Malik, Usamah bin Zayd and Khuzaymah bin Thabit said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الطَّاعُونُ رِجْزٌ.عَذَابٌ عُذِّبَ بِهِ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُم»</div><p>(The plague is a Rijz, a punishment with which Allah punished those before you.) </p><p>This is also how An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. In addition, the basis of this Hadith was collected in the Two Sahihs, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا سَمِعْتُمُ الطَّاعُونَ بأَرْضٍ فَلَا تَدْخُلُوهَا»</div><p>(If you hear of the plague in a land, then do not enter it.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir recorded Usamah bin Zayd saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّ هَذَا الْوَجَعَ وَالسَّقَمَ رِجْزٌ عُذِّبَ بِهِ بَعْضُ الْأُمَمِ قَبْلَكُم»</div><p>(This calamity and sickness (i.e. the plague) is a Rijz, a punishment with which some nations who were before you were punished.) </p><p>The basis of this Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. </p>"

They were commanded to enter the city while bowing down, but they entered while sliding on their rear ends and raising their heads! They were commanded to say, `Hittah' meaning, \"Relieve us from our errors and sins.\" However, they mocked this command and said, \"Hintah (grain seed) in Sha`irah (barley).\" This demonstrates the worst type of rebellion and disobedience, and it is why Allah released His anger and punishment upon them, all because of their sinning and defying His commands. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزًا مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ</div><p>(So We sent upon the wrongdoers Rijz (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebellion.) </p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Every word in Allah's Book that says Rijz means, `a punishment.\"' Mujahid, Abu Malik, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan and Qatadah were reported to have said that Rijz means `Torment.'

And remember your ungratefulness for what We granted you. Remember how you asked Musa to exchange this type of food for an inferior type that consists of vegetation, and so forth.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said about the Children of Israel, \"They were bored and impatient with the type of food they were provided. They also remembered the life they used to live, when their diet consisted of lentils, onions, garlic and herbs.\" They said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـمُوسَى لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَى طَعَامٍ وَحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا</div><p>(O Musa !

They said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى طَعَامٍ وَحِدٍ</div><p>(One kind of food) meaning, the manna and quails, because they ate the same food day after day. The Ayah mentioned lentils, onions and herbs, which are all known types of foods. As for the Fum, Ibn Mas`ud read it, Thum (garlic). Also, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Al-Hasan said about the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفُومِهَا</div><p>(Its Fum), \"Ibn `Abbas said that Fum means, garlic.\" </p><p>He also said that the expression, `Fumu-lanna' means, `bake for us', according to the languages of old. Ibn Jarir commented, \"If this is true, then `Fum' is one of the words whose pronounciation were altered, the letter `fa' was replaced by the letter `tha', since they are similar in sound.\" And Allah knows best. Others said that Fum is wheat, the kind used for bread. Al-Bukhari said, \"Some of them said that Fum includes all grains or seeds that are eaten.\" </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(He said, \"Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower\") criticized the Jews for asking for inferior foods, although they were living an easy life, eating tasty, beneficial and pure food. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اهْبِطُواْ مِصْرًا</div><p>(Go you down to any Misr) means, `any city', as Ibn `Abbas said. Ibn Jarir also reported that Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that the Ayah refers to Misr, the Egypt of Fir`awn. The truth is that the Ayah means any city, as Ibn `Abbas and other scholars stated. Therefore, the meaning of Musa's statement to the Children of Israel becomes, \"What you are asking for is easy, for it is available in abundance in any city that you might enter. So since what you asked for is available in all of the villages and cities, I will not ask Allah to provide us with it, especially when it is an inferior type of food. \" This is why Musa said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ اهْبِطُواْ مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ</div><p>(Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!) </p><p>Since their request was the result of boredom and arrogance and since fulfilling it was unnecessary, their request was denied.

And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidence) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins.)) (2:61) </p><h2>Covering the Jews in Humiliation and Misery</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ</div><p>(And they were covered with humiliation and misery). This Ayah indicates that the Children of Israel were plagued with humiliation, and that this will continue, meaning that it will never cease. They will continue to suffer humiliation at the hands of all who interact with them, along with the disgrace that they feel inwardly. Al-Hasan commented, \"Allah humiliated them, and they shall have no protector. Allah put them under the feet of the Muslims, who appeared at a time when the Majus (Zoroastrians) were taking the Jizyah (tax) from the Jews.\" Also, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi said that `misery' used in the Ayah means, `poverty.' `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said that `misery' means, `paying the tilth (tax).' In addition, Ad-Dahhak commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَآءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah), \"They deserved Allah's anger.\" Also, Ibn Jarir said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَآءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah) means, \"They went back with the wrath. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أُرِيدُ أَن تَبُوءَ بِإِثْمِى وَإِثْمِكَ</div><p>(Verily, I intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as yours) (Al-Ma'idah 5:29) meaning, `You will end up carrying my, and your, mistakes instead of me'. Thus, the meaning of the Ayah becomes, `They went back carrying Allah's anger; Allah's wrath descended on them; they deserved Allah's anger.\"' </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَـتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ</div><p>(That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully.) means, \"This is what We rewarded the Children of Israel with: humiliation and misery.\" Allah's anger that descended on the Children of Israel was a part of the humiliation they earned, because of their defiance of the truth, disbelief in Allah's Ayat and belittling the carriers of Allah's Law i.e. the Prophets and their following. The Children of Israel rejected the Messengers and even killed them. Surely, there is no form of disbelief worse than disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and murdering the Prophets of Allah. </p><h2>Meaning of Kibr</h2><p>Similarly, in a Hadith recorded in the Two Sahihs the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْكِبْرُ بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاس»</div><p>(`Kibr, is refusing the truth and degrading (belittling) people.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ رَجُلٌ قَتَلَهُ نَبِيٌّ أَوْ قَتَلَ نَبِيًّا: وَإِمَامُ ضَلَالَةٍ وَمُمَثِّلٌ مِنَ الْمُمَثِّلِين»</div><p>(The people who will receive the most torment on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who was killed by a Prophet or who killed a Prophet, an unjust ruler and one who mutilates (the dead).) Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ</div><p>(That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds) mentions another reason why the Children of Israel were punished in this manner, for they used to disobey and transgress the limits. Disobedience is to do what is prohibited, while transgression entails overstepping the set limits of what is allowed and what is prohibited. Allah knows best. </p>"

This shall be the case, until the Day of Judgment. Therefore, whoever follows the unlettered Messenger and Prophet shall acquire eternal happiness and shall neither fear from what will happen in the future nor become sad for what has been lost in the past. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ اللَّهِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(No doubt! Verily, the Awliya' of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve) (10:62). </p><p>The angels will proclaim to the dying believers, as mentioned, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah (alone),\" and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!\"). (41:30) </p><h2>The Meaning of Mu'min, or Believer</h2><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn `Abbas, about, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَـرَى وَالصَّـبِئِينَ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day) that Allah revealed the following Ayah afterwards, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الإِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ </div><p>(And whoever seeks religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers) (3:85). </p><p>This statement by Ibn `Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad . Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved. </p><h2>Why the Jews were called `Yahud</h2><p>The Jews are the followers of Prophet Musa, who used to refer to the Tawrah for judgment. Yahud is a word that means, `repenting', just as Musa said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا هُدْنَـآ إِلَيْكَ</div><h2>why the christians were called nasara</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(\"Who will be my helpers in Allah's cause\" Al-Hawariyyun said: \"We are the helpers of Allah.\") (61:14) </p><p>It was said that they were called `Nasara', because they inhabited a land called An-Nasirah (Nazareth), as Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn `Abbas were reported to have said, Allah knows best. Nasara is certainly plural for Nasran. </p><p>When Allah sent Muhammad as the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger to all of the Children of Adam, mankind was required to believe in him, obey him and refrain from what he prohibited them; those who do this are true believers. The Ummah of Muhammad was called `Mu'minin' (believers), because of the depth of their faith and certainty, and because they believe in all of the previous Prophets and matters of the Unseen. </p><h2>The Sabi'un or Sabians</h2><p>There is a difference of opinion over the identity of the Sabians. Sufyan Ath-Thawri said that Layth bin Abu Sulaym said that Mujahid said that, \"The Sabians are between the Majus, the Jews and the Christians. They do not have a specific religion.\" Similar is reported from Ibn Abi Najih. Similar statements were attributed to `Ata' and Sa`id bin Jubayr. They (others) say that the Sabians are a sect among the People of the Book who used to read the Zabur (Psalms), others say that they are a people who worshipped the angels or the stars. It appears that the closest opinion to the truth, and Allah knows best, is Mujahid's statement and those who agree with him like Wahb bin Munabbih, that the Sabians are neither Jews nor Christians nor Majus nor polytheists. Rather, they did not have a specific religion that they followed and enforced, because they remained living according to their Fitrah (instinctual nature). This is why the idolators used to call whoever embraced Islam a `Sabi', meaning, that he abandoned all religions that existed on the earth. Some scholars stated that the Sabians are those who never received a message by any Prophet. And Allah knows best. </p>"

The next morning, the nephew cried out for revenge, and the people took up their weapons and almost fought each other.

However, they disputed, and the matter was made more difficult for them, until they ended up looking for the specific cow that they were later ordered to slaughter. They found the designated cow with a man, only who owned that cow. He said, `By Allah! I will only sell it for its skin's fill of gold.' So they paid the cow's fill of its skin in gold, slaughtered it and touched the dead man with a part of it. He stood up, and they asked him, `Who killed you' He said, `That man,' and pointed to his nephew. He died again, and his nephew was not allowed to inherit him. Thereafter, whoever committed murder for the purpose of gaining inheritance was not allowed to inherit.\" Ibn Jarir reported something similar to that. Allah knows best. </p>"

This is why Allah forbade the believers from imitating the Jews when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَلاَ يَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الاٌّمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَـسِقُونَ </div><p>(Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah ـ Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah's Reminder (this Qur'an), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture (the Tawrah) and the Injil (Gospel)) before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened And many of them were Fasiqun (the rebellious, the disobedient to Allah)) (57:16). v In his Tafsir, Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the dead man was struck with a part of the cow, he stood up and became more alive than he ever was. He was asked, `Who killed you' He said, `My nephews killed me.' He then died again. His nephews said, after Allah took his life away, `By Allah! We did not kill him' and denied the truth while they knew it. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(And became as stones or even worse in hardness). \" </p><p>And by the passage of time, the hearts of the Children of Israel were unlikely to accept any admonishment, even after the miracles and signs they withnessed. Their hearts became harder than stones, with no hope of ever softening. Sometimes, springs and rivers burst out of stones, some stones split and water comes out of them, even if there are no springs or rivers around them, sometimes stones fall down from mountaintops out of their fear of Allah. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الأَنْهَـرُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allah), means, \"Some stones are softer than your hearts, they acknowledge the truth that you are being called to, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَـفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And Allah is not unaware of what you do).\" </p><h2>Solid Inanimate Objects possess a certain Degree of Awareness</h2><p>Some claimed that the Ayat mentioned the stones being humble as a metaphor. However, Ar-Razi, Al-Qurtubi and other Imams said that there is no need for this explanation, because Allah creates this characteristic - humbleness - in stones. For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا عَرَضْنَا الاٌّمَانَةَ عَلَى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَالْجِبَالِ فَأبَيْنَ أَن يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ مِنْهَا</div><p>(Truly, We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allah's torment)) (33:72), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ</div><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him) (17:44), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّجْمُ وَالشَّجَرُ يَسْجُدَانِ </div><p>(And the stars and the trees both prostrate themselves (to Allah)) (55:6), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَ لَمْيَرَوْاْ إِلَىخَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّأُ</div><p>(Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline) (16:48), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ</div><p>(They both said: \"We come willingly.\") (41:11), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانَ عَلَى جَبَلٍ</div><p>(Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain) (59:21), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لِجُلُودِهِمْ لِمَ شَهِدتُّمْ عَلَيْنَا قَالُواْ أَنطَقَنَا اللَّهُ</div><p>(And they will say to their skins, \"Why do you testify against us\" They will say: \"Allah has caused us to speak.\") (41:21). </p><p>It is recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هذَا جَبَلٌ يُحِبُّنَا وَنُحِبُّه»</div><p>(This (Mount Uhud) is a mount that loves us and that we love.) </p><p>Similarly, the compassion of the stump of the palm tree for the Prophet as confirmed in authentic narrations. In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَأَعْرِفُ حَجَرًا بِمَكَّةَ كَانَ يُسَلِّمُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ أُبْعَثَ إِنِّي لَأَعْرِفُهُ الْآن»</div><p>(I know a stone in Makkah that used to greet me with the Salam before I was sent. I recognize this stone now.) </p><p>He said about the Black Stone that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُ يَشْهَدُ لِمَنِ اسْتَلَمَ بِحَقَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection it will testifiy for those who kiss it.) </p><p>There are several other texts with this meaning. The scholars of the Arabic language disagreed over the meaning of Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(And became as stones or even worse in hardness) after agreeing that `or' here is not being used to reflect doubt. Some scholars said that `or' here means, `and'. So the meaning becomes, \"As hard as stones, and harder.\" For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ ءَاثِماً أَوْ كَفُوراً</div><p>(And obey not a sinner or a disbeliever among them) (76:24), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً </div><p>(To cut off all excuses or to warn) (77:6). </p><p>Some other scholars said that `or' here means, `rather'. Hence, the meaning becomes, `As hard as stones. Rather, harder.' For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(A section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more) (37:147), and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9). </p><p>Some other scholars said that this Ayah means their hearts are only of two types, as hard as stone or harder than stone. Further, Ibn Jarir commented that this Tafsir means that some of their hearts are as hard as stone and some hearts are harder than stone. Ibn Jarir said that he favored this last Tafsir, although the others are plausible. I - Ibn Kathir - say that the last Tafsir is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى اسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً</div><p>(Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire) (2:17), and then His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(Or like a rainstorm from the sky) (2:19). </p><p>It is also similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert) (24:39), and then His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَـتٍ فِى بَحْرٍ لُّجِّىٍّ</div><p>(Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea) (24:40). </p><p>This then means that some of them are like the first example, and some others are like the second example. Allah knows best. </p>"

This meaning is clarified by Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ الْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(Who know not the Book) meaning, are they not aware of what is in it. </p><p>Ummi was one of the descriptions of the Prophet because he was unlettered.

The (lunar) month is like this, this and this (i.e. thirty or twenty-nine days.) </p><p>This Hadith stated that Muslims do not need to rely on books, or calculations to decide the timings of their acts of worship.

Mujahid commented, \"Allah described the Ummiyyin as not understanding any of the Book that Allah sent down to Musa, yet they create lies and falsehood.\" Therefore, the word Amani mentioned here refers to lying and falsehood. Mujahid said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ</div><p>(And they but guess) means, \"They lie.\" Qatadah, Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` said that it means, \"They have evil false ideas about Allah.\" </p><h2>Woe unto Those Criminals among the Jews</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَـبَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـذَا مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلاً</div><p>(Then Waylun (woe) to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" to purchase with it a little price!). </p><p>This is another category of people among the Jews who called to misguidance with falsehood and lies about Allah, thriving on unjustly amassing people's property. `Waylun (woe)' carries meanings of destruction and perishing, and it is a well-known word in the Arabic language. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubadydullah bin `Abdullah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"O Muslims! How could you ask the People of the Book about anything, while the Book of Allah (Qur'an) that He revealed to His Prophet is the most recent Book from Him and you still read it fresh and young Allah told you that the People of the Book altered the Book of Allah, changed it and wrote another book with their own hands. They then said, `This book is from Allah,' so that they acquired a small profit by it. Hasn't the knowledge that came to you prohibited you from asking them By Allah! We have not seen any of them asking you about what was revealed to you.\" This Hadith was also collected by Al-Bukhari.

For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُو مِن قَبْلِهِ مِن كِتَـبٍ وَلاَ تَخُطُّهُ بِيَمِينِكَ إِذاً لاَّرْتَـبَ الْمُبْطِلُونَ </div><p>(Neither did you (O Muhammad ) read any book before it (this Qur'an) nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand. In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted) (29:48). </p><p>Also, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّا أُمَّةٌ أُمِّيَّةٌ لَا نَكْتُبُ وَلَا نَحْسِبُ، الشَّهْرُ هكَذَا وَهكَذَا وَهكَذَا»</div><p>(We are an Ummi nation, neither writing nor calculating. The (lunar) month is like this, this and this (i.e. thirty or twenty-nine days.) </p><p>This Hadith stated that Muslims do not need to rely on books, or calculations to decide the timings of their acts of worship. Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى بَعَثَ فِى الأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ</div><p>(He it is Who sent among the Ummiyyin ones a Messenger (Muhammad ) from among themselves) (62:2). </p><h2>The Explanation of Amani</h2><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ أَمَانِىَّ</div><p>(But they trust upon Amani) means, \"It is just a false statement that they utter with their tongues.\" It was also said that Amani means `wishes and hopes'. Mujahid commented, \"Allah described the Ummiyyin as not understanding any of the Book that Allah sent down to Musa, yet they create lies and falsehood.\" Therefore, the word Amani mentioned here refers to lying and falsehood. Mujahid said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ</div><p>(And they but guess) means, \"They lie.\" Qatadah, Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` said that it means, \"They have evil false ideas about Allah.\" </p><h2>Woe unto Those Criminals among the Jews</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَـبَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـذَا مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلاً</div><p>(Then Waylun (woe) to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" to purchase with it a little price!). </p><p>This is another category of people among the Jews who called to misguidance with falsehood and lies about Allah, thriving on unjustly amassing people's property. `Waylun (woe)' carries meanings of destruction and perishing, and it is a well-known word in the Arabic language. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubadydullah bin `Abdullah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"O Muslims! How could you ask the People of the Book about anything, while the Book of Allah (Qur'an) that He revealed to His Prophet is the most recent Book from Him and you still read it fresh and young Allah told you that the People of the Book altered the Book of Allah, changed it and wrote another book with their own hands. They then said, `This book is from Allah,' so that they acquired a small profit by it. Hasn't the knowledge that came to you prohibited you from asking them By Allah! We have not seen any of them asking you about what was revealed to you.\" This Hadith was also collected by Al-Bukhari. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"The little amount here means this life and all that it contains.\" </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ</div><p>(Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby) means, \"Woe to them because of what they have written with their own hands, the lies, falsehood and alterations. Woe to them because of the property that they unjustly acquired.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ</div><p>(Woe to them), \"Means the torment will be theirs because of the lies that they wrote with their own hands, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ</div><p>(And woe to them for that they earn thereby), which they unjustly acquired from people, be they commoners or otherwise.\" </p>"

He said, `You have lied; your father is so-and-so.' They said, `You have uttered the truth.' He said, `Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something' They replied, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you will know our lie as you have about our fathers.' On that he asked, `Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire' They said, `We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us in it.' The Prophet said, `May you be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.' Then he asked, `Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question' They said, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim.' He asked, `Have you poisoned this sheep' They said, `Yes.' He asked, `What made you do so' They said, `We wanted to know if you were a liar, in which case we would get rid of you, and if you were a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.') Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i recorded similarly. </p>"

They used to suffer, because of the armed conflicts between the tribes of Al-Madinah, Aws and Khazraj. Before Islam, the Aws and Khazraj worshipped idols, and many battles took place between them. There were three Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah at that time, Banu Qaynuqa` and Banu An-Nadir, the allies of the Khazraj, and Banu Qurayzah, who used to be the allies of the Aws. When war erupted between Aws and Khazraj, their Jewish allies would assist them. The Jew would kill his Arab enemy, and sometimes they also killed Jews who were the allies of the other Arab tribe, although the Jews were prohibited from killing each other according to clear religious texts in their Books. They would also drive each other from their homes and loot whatever furniture and money they could. When the war ended, the victorious Jews would release the prisoners from the defeated party, according to the rulings of the Tawrah.

      "text": "<h2>The Arrogance of the Jews who denied and killed Their Prophets</h2><p>Allah described the insolence of Children of Israel, their rebelliousness, defiance and arrogance towards the Prophets, following their lusts and desires. Allah mentioned that He gave Musa the Book, the Tawrah, and that the Jews changed, distorted, and defied its commands, as well as altered its meanings. </p><p>Allah sent Messengers and Prophets after Musa who followed his law, as Allah stated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَـبِ اللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَآءَ</div><p>(Verily, We did reveal the Tawrah (to Musa), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests (too judged for the Jews by the Tawrah after those Prophets), for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto) (5:44). This is why Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَفَّيْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ بِالرُّسُلِ</div><p>(And Qaffayna him with Messengers). </p><p>As-Suddi said that Abu Malik said that Qaffayna means, \"Succeeded\", while others said, \"Followed\". Both meanings are plausible, since Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَى</div><p>(Then We sent Our Messengers in succession) (23:44). </p><p>Thereafter, Allah sent the last Prophet among the Children of Israel, `Isa the son of Mary, who was sent with some laws that differed with some in the Tawrah. This is why Allah also sent miracles to support `Isa. These included bringing the dead back to life, forming the shape of birds from clay and blowing into them, afterwhich they became living birds by Allah's leave, healing the sick and foretelling the Unseen, as Ibn `Abbas stated. Allah also aided him with Ruh Al-Qudus, and that refers to Jibril. All of these signs testified to the truthfulness of `Isa and what he was sent with. Yet, the Children of Israel became more defiant and envious of him and did not want to differ with even one part of the Tawrah, as Allah said about `Isa, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاٌّحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَجِئْتُكُمْ بِأَيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord) (3:50). </p><p>Hence, the Children of Israel treated the Prophets in the worst manner, rejecting some of them and killing some of them. All of this occurred because the Prophets used to command the Jews with what differed from their desires and opinions. The Prophets also upheld the rulings of the Tawrah that the Jews had changed, and this is why it was difficult for them to believe in these Prophets. Therefore, they rejected the Prophets and killed some of them. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَكُلَّمَا جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لاَ تَهْوَى أَنفُسُكُم اسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًا كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًا تَقْتُلُونَ</div><p>(Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not,you grew arrogant Some you disbelieved and some you kill). </p><h2>Jibril is Ruh Al-Qudus</h2><p>The proof that Jibril is the Ruh Al-Qudus is the statement of Ibn Mas`ud in explanation of this Ayah. This is also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Isma`il bin Khalid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. Additionally, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ - عَلَى قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ </div><p>(Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:193-194). </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded `A'ishah saying that the Messenger of Allah erected a Minbar in the Masjid on which Hassan bin Thabit (the renowned poet) used to defend the Messenger of Allah (with his poems).

On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, `I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and you are the Messenger of Allah.' `Abdullah bin Salam further said, `O Allah's Messenger! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they will tell a lie about me.' The Jews came to Allah's Messenger , and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah's Messenger asked (the Jews), (`What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam') They replied, `He is the best among us, the son of the best among us, our master and the son of our master.' Allah's Messenger said, (What do you think if he would embrace Islam) The Jews said, `May Allah save him from it.' Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, `I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' Thereupon they said, `He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest among us.' And they continued talking badly about him. Ibn Salam said, `This is what I feared, O Messenger of Allah!.\"' Only Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Anas using another chain of narration. </p><p>Some people say that `il' means worshipper while whatever word that is added to it becomes Allah's Name, because `il' is a constant in such conjunction. This is similar to the names `Abdullah, `Abdur-Rahman, `Abdul-Malik, `Abdul-Quddus, `Abdus-Salam, `Abdul-Kafi, `Abdul-Jalil, and so forth. Hence, `Abd' is constant in these compound names, while the remainder differs from name to name. This is the same case with Jibril, Mika'il, `Azra'il, Israfil, and so forth. Allah knows best. </p><h2>Choosing Some Angels to believe in over Others is Disbelief like choosing Some Prophets over Others</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission,) meaning, whoever becomes an enemy of Jibril, let him know that he is Ruh Al-Qudus who brought down the Glorious Dhikr (Qur'an) to your heart from Allah by His leave. Hence, he is a messenger from Allah. Whoever takes a messenger as an enemy, will have taken all the messengers as enemies. Further, whoever believes in one messenger, is required to believe in all of the messengers. Whoever rejects one messenger, he has rejected all of the messengers.

The Book of Allah also mentions the texts in the Books of the Jews that are known to only the rabbis and scholars, and the sections where they altered and distorted the rulings of the Tawrah. Since Allah mentioned all of this in His Book revealed to His Prophet Muhammad , then this fact alone should be enough evidence for those who are truthful with themselves and who wish to avoid bringing themselves to destruction due to envy and transgression. Further human instict testifies to the truth that Muhammad was sent with and the clear signs that he brought which he did not learn or acquire from mankind. Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat) means, \"You recite and convey this Book to them day and night, although you are an Ummi (unlettered) who never read a book. Yet, you inform them of what they have (in their own Books). Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.\" </p><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2><p>When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, \"By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.\" Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَكُلَّمَا عَـهَدُواْ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم</div><p>(Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not) means, \"There is not a promise that they make, but they break it and abandon it. They make a promise today and break it tomorrow.\" </p><h2>The Jews abandoned the Book of Allah and practiced Magic</h2><p>As-Suddi commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ</div><p>(And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad ) confirming what was with them), \"When Muhammad came to them, they wanted to contradict and dispute with him using the Tawrah. However, the Tawrah and the Qur'an affirmed each other. So the Jews gave up on using the Torah, and took to the Book of Asaf, and the magic of Harut and Marut, which indeed did not conform to the Qur'an. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!).\" </p><p>Also, Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!) means, \"They knew the truth but abandoned it, hid it and denied the fact that they even had it.\" </p><h2>Magic existed before Sulayman (Solomon)</h2><p>As-Suddi said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman) means, \"`During the time of Prophet Solomon.' Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books.

Allah denied this false claim and stated to His Prophet Muhammad that Gabriel and Michael were not sent with magic.

They had knowledge of what is good and evil and what constitutes belief or disbelief, and they thus knew that magic is a form of disbelief. When the person who came to learn magic still insisted on learning it, they commanded him to go to such and such place, where if he went, Satan would meet him and teach him magic. When this man would learn magic, the light (of faith) would depart him, and he would see it shining (and flying away) in the sky. He would then proclaim, `O my sorrow! Woe unto me! What should I do.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this Ayah means, \"The angels were sent with magic, so that the people whom Allah willed would be tried and tested. Allah made them promise that they would not teach anyone until first proclaiming, `We are a test for you, do not fall into disbelief.\"' It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Qatadah said, \"Allah took their covenant to not teach anyone magic until they said, `We are a test.

When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven. Then something black that appeared to be smoke would descend and enter his ears and the rest of his body, and this is Allah's anger. When he told the angels what happened, they would teach him magic. So Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Sunayd said that Hajjaj said that Ibn Jurayj commented on this Ayah (2:102), \"No one dares practice magic except a disbeliever. As for the Fitnah, it involves trials and freedom of choice.\"The scholars who stated that learning magic is disbelief relied on this Ayah for evidence. They also mentioned the Hadith that Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded from `Abdullah, which states, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَتَى كَاهِنًا أَوْ سَاحِرًا فَصَدَّقَهُ بِمَا يَقُولُ فَقَدْ كَفَر بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلى مُحَمَّدٍصلى الله عليه وسلّم»</div><p>(Whoever came to a soothsayer or a sorcerer and believed in what he said, will have disbelieved in what Allah revealed to Muhammad .) </p><p>This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration and there are other Hadiths which support it. </p><h2>Causing a Separation between the Spouses is One of the Effects of Magic</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife,) This means, \"The people learned magic from Harut and Marut and indulged in evil acts that included separating spouses, even though spouses are close to, and intimately associate with each other. This is the devil's work.\" Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَيَضَعُ عَرْشَهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ سَرَايَاهُ فِي النَّاسِ فَأَقْرَبُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ مَنْزِلَةً أَعْظَمُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ فِتْنَةً وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا زِلْتُ بِفُلَانٍ حَتَّى تَرَكْتُهُ وَهُوَ يَقُولُ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَيَقُولُ إِبْلِيسُ: لَا وَاللهِ مَا صَنَعْتَ شَيْئًا، وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا تَرَكْتُهُ حَتّى فَرَّقْتُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ أَهْلِهِ، قَالَ: فَيُقرِّبُهُ وَيُدْنِيهِ وَيَلْتَزِمُهُ وَيَقُولُ: نِعْمَ أَنْت»</div><p>(Satan erects his throne on water and sends his emissaries among the people. The closest person to him is the person who causes the most Fitnah. One of them (a devil) would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until he said such and such words.' Iblis says, `No, by Allah, you have not done much.' Another devil would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until I separated between him and his wife.' Satan would draw him closer and embrace him, saying, `Yes, you did well.') </p><p>Separation between a man and his wife occurs here because each spouse imagines that the other spouse is ugly or ill-mannered, etc. </p><h2>Allah's Appointed Term supercedes Everything</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave). Sufyan Ath-Thawri commented, \"Except by Allah's appointed term.\" Further, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave) means, \"Allah allows magicians to adversely affect whomever He wills and saves whomever He wills from them.

The Book of Allah also mentions the texts in the Books of the Jews that are known to only the rabbis and scholars, and the sections where they altered and distorted the rulings of the Tawrah. Since Allah mentioned all of this in His Book revealed to His Prophet Muhammad , then this fact alone should be enough evidence for those who are truthful with themselves and who wish to avoid bringing themselves to destruction due to envy and transgression. Further human instict testifies to the truth that Muhammad was sent with and the clear signs that he brought which he did not learn or acquire from mankind. Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat) means, \"You recite and convey this Book to them day and night, although you are an Ummi (unlettered) who never read a book. Yet, you inform them of what they have (in their own Books). Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.\" </p><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2><p>When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, \"By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.\" Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَكُلَّمَا عَـهَدُواْ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم</div><p>(Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not) means, \"There is not a promise that they make, but they break it and abandon it. They make a promise today and break it tomorrow.\" </p><h2>The Jews abandoned the Book of Allah and practiced Magic</h2><p>As-Suddi commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ</div><p>(And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad ) confirming what was with them), \"When Muhammad came to them, they wanted to contradict and dispute with him using the Tawrah. However, the Tawrah and the Qur'an affirmed each other. So the Jews gave up on using the Torah, and took to the Book of Asaf, and the magic of Harut and Marut, which indeed did not conform to the Qur'an. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!).\" </p><p>Also, Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!) means, \"They knew the truth but abandoned it, hid it and denied the fact that they even had it.\" </p><h2>Magic existed before Sulayman (Solomon)</h2><p>As-Suddi said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman) means, \"`During the time of Prophet Solomon.' Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved). </p><h2>The Story of Harut and Marut, and the Explanation that They were Angels</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـرُوتَ وَمَـرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife). </p><p>There is a difference of opinion regarding this story.

When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven.

The Book of Allah also mentions the texts in the Books of the Jews that are known to only the rabbis and scholars, and the sections where they altered and distorted the rulings of the Tawrah. Since Allah mentioned all of this in His Book revealed to His Prophet Muhammad , then this fact alone should be enough evidence for those who are truthful with themselves and who wish to avoid bringing themselves to destruction due to envy and transgression. Further human instict testifies to the truth that Muhammad was sent with and the clear signs that he brought which he did not learn or acquire from mankind. Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat) means, \"You recite and convey this Book to them day and night, although you are an Ummi (unlettered) who never read a book. Yet, you inform them of what they have (in their own Books). Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.\" </p><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2><p>When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, \"By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.\" Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَكُلَّمَا عَـهَدُواْ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم</div><p>(Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not) means, \"There is not a promise that they make, but they break it and abandon it. They make a promise today and break it tomorrow.\" </p><h2>The Jews abandoned the Book of Allah and practiced Magic</h2><p>As-Suddi commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ</div><p>(And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad ) confirming what was with them), \"When Muhammad came to them, they wanted to contradict and dispute with him using the Tawrah. However, the Tawrah and the Qur'an affirmed each other. So the Jews gave up on using the Torah, and took to the Book of Asaf, and the magic of Harut and Marut, which indeed did not conform to the Qur'an. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!).\" </p><p>Also, Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!) means, \"They knew the truth but abandoned it, hid it and denied the fact that they even had it.\" </p><h2>Magic existed before Sulayman (Solomon)</h2><p>As-Suddi said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman) means, \"`During the time of Prophet Solomon.' Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved). </p><h2>The Story of Harut and Marut, and the Explanation that They were Angels</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـرُوتَ وَمَـرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife). </p><p>There is a difference of opinion regarding this story. It was said that this Ayah denies that anything was sent down to the two angels, as Al-Qurtubi stated and then referred to the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve) saying, \"The negation applies in both cases. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(But the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels). </p><p>The Jews claimed that Gabriel and Michael brought magic down to the two angels, but Allah refuted this false claim.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir reported, that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels) </p><p>\"Allah did not send magic down.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said about, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(And such things that came down to the two angels), \"Allah did not send magic down to the them.\" Ibn Jarir commented, \"This is the correct explanation for this Ayah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) meaning, magic. However, neither did Solomon disbelieve nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. The devils, on the other hand, disbelieved and taught magic to the people of the Babylon of Harut and Marut.\" </p><p>Ibn Jarir continued; \"If someone asks about explaining this Ayah in this manner, we say that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) means, magic. Solomon neither disbelieved nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. However, the devils disbelieved and taught magic to the people in the Babylon of Harut and Marut, meaning Gabriel and Michael, for Jewish sorcerers claimed that Allah sent magic by the words of Gabriel and Michael to Solomon, son of David. Allah denied this false claim and stated to His Prophet Muhammad that Gabriel and Michael were not sent with magic. Allah also exonerated Solomon from practicing magic, which the devils taught to the people of Babylon by the hands of two men, Harut and Marut. Hence, Harut and Marut were two ordinary men (not angels or Gabriel or Michael).\" These were the words of At-Tabari, and this explanation is not plausible. </p><p>Many among the Salaf, said that Harut and Marut were angels who came down from heaven to earth and did what they did as the Ayah stated. To conform this opinion with the fact that the angels are immune from error, we say that Allah had eternal knowledge what these angels would do, just as He had eternal knowledge that Iblis would do as he did, while Allah refered to him being among the angels, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى </div><p>(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused) (20:116) and so forth. However, what Harut and Marut did was less evil than what Iblis, may Allah curse him, did. Al-Qurtubi reported this opinion from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, As-Suddi and Al-Kalbi. </p><h2>Learning Magic is Kufr</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that Qays bin `Abbad said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When someone came to the angels to learn magic, they would discourage him and say to him, `We are only a test, so do not fall into disbelief.' They had knowledge of what is good and evil and what constitutes belief or disbelief, and they thus knew that magic is a form of disbelief. When the person who came to learn magic still insisted on learning it, they commanded him to go to such and such place, where if he went, Satan would meet him and teach him magic. When this man would learn magic, the light (of faith) would depart him, and he would see it shining (and flying away) in the sky. He would then proclaim, `O my sorrow! Woe unto me! What should I do.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this Ayah means, \"The angels were sent with magic, so that the people whom Allah willed would be tried and tested. Allah made them promise that they would not teach anyone until first proclaiming, `We are a test for you, do not fall into disbelief.\"' It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Qatadah said, \"Allah took their covenant to not teach anyone magic until they said, `We are a test. Therefore, do not fall in disbelief.\"' </p><p>Also, As-Suddi said, \"When a man would come to the two angels they would advise him, `Do not fall into disbelief. We are a test. ' When the man would ignore their advice, they would say, `Go to that pile of ashes and urinate on it.' When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven. Then something black that appeared to be smoke would descend and enter his ears and the rest of his body, and this is Allah's anger. When he told the angels what happened, they would teach him magic. So Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Sunayd said that Hajjaj said that Ibn Jurayj commented on this Ayah (2:102), \"No one dares practice magic except a disbeliever.

The Book of Allah also mentions the texts in the Books of the Jews that are known to only the rabbis and scholars, and the sections where they altered and distorted the rulings of the Tawrah. Since Allah mentioned all of this in His Book revealed to His Prophet Muhammad , then this fact alone should be enough evidence for those who are truthful with themselves and who wish to avoid bringing themselves to destruction due to envy and transgression. Further human instict testifies to the truth that Muhammad was sent with and the clear signs that he brought which he did not learn or acquire from mankind. Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat) means, \"You recite and convey this Book to them day and night, although you are an Ummi (unlettered) who never read a book. Yet, you inform them of what they have (in their own Books). Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.\" </p><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2><p>When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, \"By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.\" Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَكُلَّمَا عَـهَدُواْ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم</div><p>(Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not) means, \"There is not a promise that they make, but they break it and abandon it. They make a promise today and break it tomorrow.\" </p><h2>The Jews abandoned the Book of Allah and practiced Magic</h2><p>As-Suddi commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ</div><p>(And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad ) confirming what was with them), \"When Muhammad came to them, they wanted to contradict and dispute with him using the Tawrah. However, the Tawrah and the Qur'an affirmed each other. So the Jews gave up on using the Torah, and took to the Book of Asaf, and the magic of Harut and Marut, which indeed did not conform to the Qur'an. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!).\" </p><p>Also, Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!) means, \"They knew the truth but abandoned it, hid it and denied the fact that they even had it.\" </p><h2>Magic existed before Sulayman (Solomon)</h2><p>As-Suddi said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman) means, \"`During the time of Prophet Solomon.' Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved). </p><h2>The Story of Harut and Marut, and the Explanation that They were Angels</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـرُوتَ وَمَـرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife). </p><p>There is a difference of opinion regarding this story. It was said that this Ayah denies that anything was sent down to the two angels, as Al-Qurtubi stated and then referred to the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve) saying, \"The negation applies in both cases. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(But the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels). </p><p>The Jews claimed that Gabriel and Michael brought magic down to the two angels, but Allah refuted this false claim.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir reported, that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels) </p><p>\"Allah did not send magic down.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said about, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(And such things that came down to the two angels), \"Allah did not send magic down to the them.\" Ibn Jarir commented, \"This is the correct explanation for this Ayah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) meaning, magic. However, neither did Solomon disbelieve nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. The devils, on the other hand, disbelieved and taught magic to the people of the Babylon of Harut and Marut.\" </p><p>Ibn Jarir continued; \"If someone asks about explaining this Ayah in this manner, we say that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) means, magic. Solomon neither disbelieved nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. However, the devils disbelieved and taught magic to the people in the Babylon of Harut and Marut, meaning Gabriel and Michael, for Jewish sorcerers claimed that Allah sent magic by the words of Gabriel and Michael to Solomon, son of David. Allah denied this false claim and stated to His Prophet Muhammad that Gabriel and Michael were not sent with magic. Allah also exonerated Solomon from practicing magic, which the devils taught to the people of Babylon by the hands of two men, Harut and Marut. Hence, Harut and Marut were two ordinary men (not angels or Gabriel or Michael).\" These were the words of At-Tabari, and this explanation is not plausible. </p><p>Many among the Salaf, said that Harut and Marut were angels who came down from heaven to earth and did what they did as the Ayah stated. To conform this opinion with the fact that the angels are immune from error, we say that Allah had eternal knowledge what these angels would do, just as He had eternal knowledge that Iblis would do as he did, while Allah refered to him being among the angels, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى </div><p>(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused) (20:116) and so forth. However, what Harut and Marut did was less evil than what Iblis, may Allah curse him, did. Al-Qurtubi reported this opinion from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, As-Suddi and Al-Kalbi. </p><h2>Learning Magic is Kufr</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that Qays bin `Abbad said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When someone came to the angels to learn magic, they would discourage him and say to him, `We are only a test, so do not fall into disbelief.' They had knowledge of what is good and evil and what constitutes belief or disbelief, and they thus knew that magic is a form of disbelief. When the person who came to learn magic still insisted on learning it, they commanded him to go to such and such place, where if he went, Satan would meet him and teach him magic. When this man would learn magic, the light (of faith) would depart him, and he would see it shining (and flying away) in the sky. He would then proclaim, `O my sorrow! Woe unto me! What should I do.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this Ayah means, \"The angels were sent with magic, so that the people whom Allah willed would be tried and tested. Allah made them promise that they would not teach anyone until first proclaiming, `We are a test for you, do not fall into disbelief.\"' It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Qatadah said, \"Allah took their covenant to not teach anyone magic until they said, `We are a test. Therefore, do not fall in disbelief.\"' </p><p>Also, As-Suddi said, \"When a man would come to the two angels they would advise him, `Do not fall into disbelief. We are a test. ' When the man would ignore their advice, they would say, `Go to that pile of ashes and urinate on it.' When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven. Then something black that appeared to be smoke would descend and enter his ears and the rest of his body, and this is Allah's anger. When he told the angels what happened, they would teach him magic. So Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Sunayd said that Hajjaj said that Ibn Jurayj commented on this Ayah (2:102), \"No one dares practice magic except a disbeliever. As for the Fitnah, it involves trials and freedom of choice.\"The scholars who stated that learning magic is disbelief relied on this Ayah for evidence. They also mentioned the Hadith that Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded from `Abdullah, which states, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَتَى كَاهِنًا أَوْ سَاحِرًا فَصَدَّقَهُ بِمَا يَقُولُ فَقَدْ كَفَر بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلى مُحَمَّدٍصلى الله عليه وسلّم»</div><p>(Whoever came to a soothsayer or a sorcerer and believed in what he said, will have disbelieved in what Allah revealed to Muhammad .) </p><p>This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration and there are other Hadiths which support it. </p><h2>Causing a Separation between the Spouses is One of the Effects of Magic</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife,) This means, \"The people learned magic from Harut and Marut and indulged in evil acts that included separating spouses, even though spouses are close to, and intimately associate with each other. This is the devil's work.\" Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَيَضَعُ عَرْشَهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ سَرَايَاهُ فِي النَّاسِ فَأَقْرَبُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ مَنْزِلَةً أَعْظَمُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ فِتْنَةً وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا زِلْتُ بِفُلَانٍ حَتَّى تَرَكْتُهُ وَهُوَ يَقُولُ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَيَقُولُ إِبْلِيسُ: لَا وَاللهِ مَا صَنَعْتَ شَيْئًا، وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا تَرَكْتُهُ حَتّى فَرَّقْتُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ أَهْلِهِ، قَالَ: فَيُقرِّبُهُ وَيُدْنِيهِ وَيَلْتَزِمُهُ وَيَقُولُ: نِعْمَ أَنْت»</div><p>(Satan erects his throne on water and sends his emissaries among the people. The closest person to him is the person who causes the most Fitnah. One of them (a devil) would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until he said such and such words.' Iblis says, `No, by Allah, you have not done much.' Another devil would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until I separated between him and his wife.' Satan would draw him closer and embrace him, saying, `Yes, you did well.') </p><p>Separation between a man and his wife occurs here because each spouse imagines that the other spouse is ugly or ill-mannered, etc. </p><h2>Allah's Appointed Term supercedes Everything</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave).

Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.\" </p><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2><p>When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, \"By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.\" Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَكُلَّمَا عَـهَدُواْ عَهْدًا نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم</div><p>(Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not) means, \"There is not a promise that they make, but they break it and abandon it. They make a promise today and break it tomorrow.\" </p><h2>The Jews abandoned the Book of Allah and practiced Magic</h2><p>As-Suddi commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ</div><p>(And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah (i.e. Muhammad ) confirming what was with them), \"When Muhammad came to them, they wanted to contradict and dispute with him using the Tawrah. However, the Tawrah and the Qur'an affirmed each other. So the Jews gave up on using the Torah, and took to the Book of Asaf, and the magic of Harut and Marut, which indeed did not conform to the Qur'an. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!).\" </p><p>Also, Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(As if they did not know!) means, \"They knew the truth but abandoned it, hid it and denied the fact that they even had it.\" </p><h2>Magic existed before Sulayman (Solomon)</h2><p>As-Suddi said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman) means, \"`During the time of Prophet Solomon.' Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved). </p><h2>The Story of Harut and Marut, and the Explanation that They were Angels</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـرُوتَ وَمَـرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife). </p><p>There is a difference of opinion regarding this story. It was said that this Ayah denies that anything was sent down to the two angels, as Al-Qurtubi stated and then referred to the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ</div><p>(Sulayman did not disbelieve) saying, \"The negation applies in both cases. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(But the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels). </p><p>The Jews claimed that Gabriel and Michael brought magic down to the two angels, but Allah refuted this false claim.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir reported, that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ</div><p>(And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels) </p><p>\"Allah did not send magic down.\" </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said about, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ</div><p>(And such things that came down to the two angels), \"Allah did not send magic down to the them.\" Ibn Jarir commented, \"This is the correct explanation for this Ayah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) meaning, magic. However, neither did Solomon disbelieve nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. The devils, on the other hand, disbelieved and taught magic to the people of the Babylon of Harut and Marut.\" </p><p>Ibn Jarir continued; \"If someone asks about explaining this Ayah in this manner, we say that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ</div><p>(They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) means, magic. Solomon neither disbelieved nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. However, the devils disbelieved and taught magic to the people in the Babylon of Harut and Marut, meaning Gabriel and Michael, for Jewish sorcerers claimed that Allah sent magic by the words of Gabriel and Michael to Solomon, son of David. Allah denied this false claim and stated to His Prophet Muhammad that Gabriel and Michael were not sent with magic. Allah also exonerated Solomon from practicing magic, which the devils taught to the people of Babylon by the hands of two men, Harut and Marut. Hence, Harut and Marut were two ordinary men (not angels or Gabriel or Michael).\" These were the words of At-Tabari, and this explanation is not plausible. </p><p>Many among the Salaf, said that Harut and Marut were angels who came down from heaven to earth and did what they did as the Ayah stated. To conform this opinion with the fact that the angels are immune from error, we say that Allah had eternal knowledge what these angels would do, just as He had eternal knowledge that Iblis would do as he did, while Allah refered to him being among the angels, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى </div><p>(And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused) (20:116) and so forth. However, what Harut and Marut did was less evil than what Iblis, may Allah curse him, did. Al-Qurtubi reported this opinion from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, As-Suddi and Al-Kalbi. </p><h2>Learning Magic is Kufr</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that Qays bin `Abbad said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When someone came to the angels to learn magic, they would discourage him and say to him, `We are only a test, so do not fall into disbelief.' They had knowledge of what is good and evil and what constitutes belief or disbelief, and they thus knew that magic is a form of disbelief. When the person who came to learn magic still insisted on learning it, they commanded him to go to such and such place, where if he went, Satan would meet him and teach him magic. When this man would learn magic, the light (of faith) would depart him, and he would see it shining (and flying away) in the sky. He would then proclaim, `O my sorrow! Woe unto me! What should I do.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this Ayah means, \"The angels were sent with magic, so that the people whom Allah willed would be tried and tested. Allah made them promise that they would not teach anyone until first proclaiming, `We are a test for you, do not fall into disbelief.\"' It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Qatadah said, \"Allah took their covenant to not teach anyone magic until they said, `We are a test. Therefore, do not fall in disbelief.\"' </p><p>Also, As-Suddi said, \"When a man would come to the two angels they would advise him, `Do not fall into disbelief. We are a test. ' When the man would ignore their advice, they would say, `Go to that pile of ashes and urinate on it.' When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven. Then something black that appeared to be smoke would descend and enter his ears and the rest of his body, and this is Allah's anger. When he told the angels what happened, they would teach him magic. So Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ</div><p>(But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).) </p><p>Sunayd said that Hajjaj said that Ibn Jurayj commented on this Ayah (2:102), \"No one dares practice magic except a disbeliever. As for the Fitnah, it involves trials and freedom of choice.\"The scholars who stated that learning magic is disbelief relied on this Ayah for evidence. They also mentioned the Hadith that Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded from `Abdullah, which states, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَتَى كَاهِنًا أَوْ سَاحِرًا فَصَدَّقَهُ بِمَا يَقُولُ فَقَدْ كَفَر بِمَا أُنْزِلَ عَلى مُحَمَّدٍصلى الله عليه وسلّم»</div><p>(Whoever came to a soothsayer or a sorcerer and believed in what he said, will have disbelieved in what Allah revealed to Muhammad .) </p><p>This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration and there are other Hadiths which support it. </p><h2>Causing a Separation between the Spouses is One of the Effects of Magic</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ</div><p>(And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife,) This means, \"The people learned magic from Harut and Marut and indulged in evil acts that included separating spouses, even though spouses are close to, and intimately associate with each other. This is the devil's work.\" Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَيَضَعُ عَرْشَهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ سَرَايَاهُ فِي النَّاسِ فَأَقْرَبُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ مَنْزِلَةً أَعْظَمُهُمْ عِنْدَهُ فِتْنَةً وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا زِلْتُ بِفُلَانٍ حَتَّى تَرَكْتُهُ وَهُوَ يَقُولُ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَيَقُولُ إِبْلِيسُ: لَا وَاللهِ مَا صَنَعْتَ شَيْئًا، وَيَجِيءُ أَحَدُهُمْ فَيَقُولُ: مَا تَرَكْتُهُ حَتّى فَرَّقْتُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ أَهْلِهِ، قَالَ: فَيُقرِّبُهُ وَيُدْنِيهِ وَيَلْتَزِمُهُ وَيَقُولُ: نِعْمَ أَنْت»</div><p>(Satan erects his throne on water and sends his emissaries among the people. The closest person to him is the person who causes the most Fitnah. One of them (a devil) would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until he said such and such words.' Iblis says, `No, by Allah, you have not done much.' Another devil would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until I separated between him and his wife.' Satan would draw him closer and embrace him, saying, `Yes, you did well.') </p><p>Separation between a man and his wife occurs here because each spouse imagines that the other spouse is ugly or ill-mannered, etc. </p><h2>Allah's Appointed Term supercedes Everything</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave). Sufyan Ath-Thawri commented, \"Except by Allah's appointed term.\" Further, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave) means, \"Allah allows magicians to adversely affect whomever He wills and saves whomever He wills from them. Sorcerers never bring harm to anyone except by Allah's leave.\" Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ</div><p>(And they learn that which harms them and profits them not.) means, it harms their religion and does not have a benefit compared to its harm. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُواْ لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَـقٍ</div><p>(And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no (Khalaq) share in the Hereafter.) meaning, \"The Jews who preferred magic over following the Messenger of Allah knew that those who commit the same error shall have no Khalaq in the Hereafter.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and As-Suddi stated that `no Khalaq' means, `no share.' </p><p>Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ الشَّيَـطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـنَ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـنُ وَلَـكِنَّ الشَّيْاطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـرُوتَ وَمَـرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّى يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُواْ لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَـقٍ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ - وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواْ واتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their own selves, if they but knew.

Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ يُحَرِّفُونَ الْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَاسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَعِنَا لَيّاً بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْناً فِى الدِّينِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَاسْمَعْ وَانْظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً </div><p>(Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: \"We hear your word (O Muhammad ) and disobey,\" and \"Hear and let you (O Muhammad ) hear nothing.\" And Ra`ina with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said: \"We hear and obey,\" and \"Do make us understand,\" it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few) (4:46). </p><p>Also, the Hadiths stated that when they would greet Muslims, they would say, `As-Samu `alaykum,' meaning, `death be to you'. This is why we were commanded to answer them by saying, `Wa `alaykum,' meaning, `and to you too', then our supplication against them shall be answered, rather than theirs against us. </p><p>Allah forbade the believers from imitating the disbelievers in tongue or deed. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَقُولُواْ رَعِنَا وَقُولُواْ انظُرْنَا وَاسْمَعُواْ وَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </div><p>(O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger ) Ra`ina but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment) (2:104). </p><p>Also, Imam Ahmad narrated that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ السَّاعَةِ بِالسَّيْفِ حَتَّى يُعْبَدَاللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَجُعِلَ رِزْقِي تَحْتَ ظِلِّ رُمْحِي، وَجُعِلَتِ الذِّلَّةُ وَالصَّغَارُ عَلَى مَنْ خَالَفَ أَمْرِي، وَمَنْ تَشَبَّهَ بِقَومٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(I was sent with the sword just before the Last Hour, so that Allah is worshipped alone without partners. My sustenance was provided for me from under the shadow of my spear. Those who oppose my command were humiliated and made inferior, and whoever imitates a people, he is one of them.) </p><p>Abu Dawud narrated that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ تَشَبَّهَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُم»</div><p>(Whoever imitates a people is one of them.) </p><p>These Hadiths indicate, along with their threats and warnings, that we are not allowed to imitate the disbelievers in their statements, deeds, clothes, feasts, acts of worship, etc., whatever actions of the disbelievers that were not legislated for us. </p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَقُولُواْ رَعِنَا</div><p>(Say not (to the Messenger ) Ra`ina) \"They used to say to the Prophet , Ar`ina samak (which is an insult).\" Ibn Abu Hatim said that it was reported that Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah said similarly. Further, Mujahid said, \"`Do not say Ra`ina' means, `Do not dispute'.\" Mujahid said in another narration, \"Do not say, `We hear from you, and you hear from us.\"' Also, `Ata' said, \"Do not say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَعِنَا</div><p>(Ra`ina), which was a dialect that the Ansar used and which was forbidden from use by Allah.\" </p><p>Also, As-Suddi said, \"Rifa`ah bin Zayd, a Jewish man from the tribe of Qaynuqa`, used to come to the Prophet and say to him, `Hear, Ghayr Musma'in (let you hear nothing).' The Muslims used to think that the Prophets are greeted and honored with this type of speech, and this is why some of them used to say, `Hear, let you hear nothing,' and so on, as mentioned in Surat An-Nisa.\" Thereafter, Allah forbade the believers from uttering the word Ra`ina.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam also said similarly. </p><h2>The extreme Enmity that the Disbelievers and the People of the Book have against Muslims</h2><p>Allah said next (2:105), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ وَلاَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(Neither those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrikin (the idolaters), like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord). </p><p>Allah described the deep enmity that the disbelieving polytheists and People of the Scripture, whom Allah warned against imitating, have against the believers, so that Muslims should sever all friendship with them. Also, Allah mentioned what He granted the believers of the perfect Law that He legislated for their Prophet Muhammad . Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</div><p>(But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty) (2:105). </p>"

He also brings success to whom He wills and failure to whom He wills. He judges between His servants as He wills, allows what He wills and disallows what He wills. He decides what He wills, there is no opponent for His judgment, and no one can question Him about what He does, while they shall be questioned. He tests His servants and their obedience to His Messengers by the Naskh. He commands a matter containing a benefit which He knows of, and then He out of His wisdom, prohibits it. Hence, perfect obedience is realized by adhering to His commands, following His Messengers, believing in what ever they convey, implementing their commands and avoiding what they prohibit. </p><p>The statements of Allah here contain tremendous benefit, prove that the Jews are disbelievers and refute their claim that Naskh does not occur, may Allah curse the Jews.

The Jews also denied the prophethood of Jesus and Muhammad, because of their dislike for what they brought from Allah, such as changing some rulings of the Torah, as Allah commanded. Allah thus proclaimed to the Jews that He owns the heavens and earth and also all authority in them. Further, the subjects in Allah's kingdom are His creation, and they are required to hear and obey His commands and prohibitions. Allah has full authority to command the creation as He wills, forbidding them from what He wills, abrogate what He wills, uphold what He wills, and decide whatever commandments and prohibitions He wills.\" </p><p>I (Ibn Kathir) say that the Jews' dismissal of the occurrence of the Naskh is only a case of their disbelief and rebellion. The sound mind does not deny that there could be a Naskh in Allah's commandments, for He decides what He wills, just as He does what He wills. Further, Naskh occurred in previous Books and Law. For instance, Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons and then later forbade this practice. Allah also allowed Nuh to eat from all kinds of animals after they left the ark, then prohibited eating some types of foods. Further, marrying two sisters to one man was allowed for Israel and his children, but Allah prohibited this practice later in the Torah. Allah commanded Abraham to slaughter his son, then repealed that command before it was implemented. Also, Allah commanded the Children of Israel to kill those who worshipped the calf and then repealed that command, so that the Children of Israel were not all exterminated. There are many other instances that the Jews admit have occurred, yet they ignore them. Also, it is a well-known fact that their Books foretold about Muhammad and contained the command to follow him. These texts, in their Books, indicate that the Jews were required to follow the Prophet Muhammad and that no good deed would be accepted from them, unless it conformed to Muhammad's Law. The Prophet brought another Book, - the Qur'an -, which is the last revelation from Allah. </p>"

Therefore, do not ask about matters that have not occurred yet, for they might become prohibited, due to your questions.\" This is why the Sahih narrated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَعْظَمَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ جُرْمًا مَنْ سَأَلَ عَنْ شَيْءٍ لَمْ يُحَرَّمْ، فَحُرِّمَ مِنْ أَجْلِ مَسْأَلَتِه»</div><p>(The greatest criminal among the Muslims is the one who asks if a thing is prohibited, which is not prohibited, and it becomes prohibited because of his asking about it.) </p><p>This is why when the Messenger of Allah was asked about a husband who finds another man with his wife; if he exposes the adultery, he will be exposing a major incident; if he is quiet about it, he will be quiet about a major matter. The Messenger of Allah did not like such questions. Later on, Allah revealed the ruling of Mula`anah Refer to Nur 24:6-9 in the Qur'an. The Two Sahihs recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said that the Messenger of Allah \"Forbade saying, `It was said' and `He said,' and wasting money and asking many questions.\" Muslim recorded that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«ذَرُونِي مَا تَرَكْتُكُمْ، فَإِنَّمَا هَلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ بِكَثْرَةِ سُؤَالِهِمْ وَاخْتِلَافِهِمْ عَلى أَنْبِيَائِهِمْ، فَإِذَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِأَمْرٍ فَأْتُوا مِنْهُ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ وَإِنْ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ فَاجْتَنِبُوه»</div><p>(Leave me as I leave you; those before you were only destroyed because of their excessive questioning and disputing with their Prophets. Therefore, when I command you with a matter, adhere to it as much as you can, and when I forbid from something, avoid it.) </p><p>The Prophet only said this after he told the Companions that Allah has ordered them to perform Hajj. A man asked, \"Every year, O Messenger of Allah\" The Prophet did not answer him, but he repeated his question three times. Then the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، وَلَوْ قُلْتُ: نَعَمْ، لَوَجَبَتْ وَلَوْ وَجَبَتْ لَمَا اسْتَطَعْتُم»</div><p>(No. Had I said yes, it would have been ordained, and you would not have been able to implement it.) </p><p>This is why Anas bin Malik said, \"We were forbidden from asking the Messenger of Allah about things.

For there are two conditions for deeds to be accepted; the deed must be performed for Allah's sake alone and conform to the Shari`ah.

The Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَد»</div><p>(Whoever performs a deed that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected.) </p><p>This Hadith was recorded by Muslim. Therefore, the good deeds of the priests and rabbis will not be accepted, even if they are sincerely for Allah alone, because these deeds do not conform with the method of the Messenger , who was sent for all mankind.

Then a Christian man from Najran's delegation said to the Jews, `Rather, you do not follow anything,' and he reiterated his rejection of Musa's prophethood and his disbelief in the Torah. So Allah revealed the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَـرَى عَلَى شَىْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَـرَى لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَى شَىْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. )\" </p><p>Allah made it clear that each party read the affirmation of what they claimed to reject in their Book. Consequently, the Jews disbelieve in Jesus, even though they have the Torah in which Allah took their Covenant by the tongue of Moses to believe in Jesus.

Abu Ja`far bin Jarir chose the view that this Ayah is general and that there is no evidence that specifically supports any of these explanations. So interpreting the Ayah in a general way is better.

He then agreed to a peace treaty with the idolators and said to them, (No one before has ever prevented people from entering the House.

Therefore, Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَـجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ وَءاتَى الزَّكَوةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ</div><p>(The Masjids of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day; perform the Salah, and give the Zakah and fear none but Allah). Therefore, if those believers who follow the virtues mentioned in the Ayah were prevented from attending the Masjid, then what cause for destruction is worse than this Maintaining the Masjids not only means beautifying them, but it involves remembering Allah, establishing His Shari`ah in the Masjids and purifying them from the filth of Shirk. </p><h2>The Good News that Islam shall prevail</h2><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَآ إِلاَّ خَآئِفِينَ</div><p>(It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah's Masjids) except in fear). </p><p>This Ayah means, \"Do not allow them - the disbelievers - to enter the Masjids, except to satisfy the terms of an armistice or a treaty.\" When the Messenger of Allah conquered Makkah in 9 H, he commanded that someone announce at Mina, \"After the current year, no idolators shall perform Hajj, and no naked persons shall perform Tawaf around the House, except for those who have a treaty. In this case, the treaty will be carried to the end of its term.\" This Ayah supports the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ فَلاَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا</div><p>(O you who believe!

Soon after, the Ayah indicated, no idolator shall enter the House, except out of fear of being seized or killed, unless he embraces Islam. Allah fulfilled this promise and later decreed that idolators not be allowed to enter Al-Masjid Al-Haram. The Messenger of Allah stated that no two religions should remain in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Jews and Christians should be expelled from it, all praise is due to Allah. All of these rulings ensure maintaining the honor of Al-Masjid Al-Haram and purifying the area where Allah sent His Messenger to warn and bring good news to all of mankind, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him. </p><p>This Ayah also described the disgrace that the disbelievers earn in this life, and that the punishment comes in a form comparable to the deed. Just as they prevented the believers from entering Al-Masjid Al-Haram, they were prevented from entering it in turn. Just as they expelled the believers from Makkah, they were in turn expelled from Makkah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter) because they breached the sanctity of the House and brought filth to it by erecting idols all around it, invoking other than Allah and performing Tawaf around it while naked, etc. </p><p>Here it is worth mentioning the Hadith about seeking refuge from disgrace in this life and the torment of the Hereafter. Imam Ahmad recorded that Busr bin Artah said that the Messenger of Allah used to supplicate, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ أَحْسِنْ عَاقِبَتَنَا فِي الْأُمُورِ كُلِّهَا وَأَجِرْنَا مِنْ خِزْيِ الدُّنْيَا وَعَذَابِ الْآخِرَة»</div><p>(O Allah!

In Makkah, the Messenger of Allah used to pray in the direction of Bayt Al-Maqdis, while the Ka`bah was between him and the Qiblah. When the Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, he faced Bayt Al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months, and then Allah directed him to face Al-Ka`bah in prayer. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne)). </p><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The first part of the Qur'an that was abrogated was about the Qiblah.

The Jews were happy, and the Messenger of Allah faced Bayt Al-Maqdis for some ten months. However, the Messenger of Allah liked to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim (Al-Ka`bah at Makkah), and he used to look to the sky and supplicate.

Ibn Jarir said, \"Others said that this Ayah was revealed to the Messenger of Allah permitting the one praying voluntary prayers to face wherever they wish in the east or west, while traveling, when in fear and when facing the enemy.\" For instance, Ibn `Umar used to face whatever direction his animal was headed and proclaim that the Messenger of Allah did the same, explaining the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(So wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah).\" </p><p>That Hadith was also collected by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwyah, and its origin is in the Two Sahihs from Ibn `Umar and `Amr bin Rabi`ah without mentioning the Ayah.

And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers) (3:67-68). </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِكَلِمَـتِ</div><p>(with Kalimat (words)) which means, \"Laws, commandments and prohibitions.\" `Words' as mentioned here, sometimes refers to what Allah has willed, such as Allah's statement about Maryam, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَـتِ رَبَّهَا وَكُتُبِهِ وَكَانَتْ مِنَ الْقَـنِتِينَ</div><p>(And she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord, and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qanitin (i.e. obedient to Allah)) (66:12). </p><p>\"Words\" also refers to Allah's Law, such as Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</div><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6:115) meaning, His legislation. \"Words\" also means truthful news, or a just commandment or prohibition. For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ</div><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) Words (commands), which he fulfilled) meaning, he adhered to them, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</div><p>(\"Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind (to follow you).\") as a reward for Ibrahim's good deeds, adhering to the commandments and avoiding the prohibitions. This is why Allah made Ibrahim a role model for the people, and an Imam whose conduct and path are imitated and followed. </p><h2>What were the Words that Ibrahim was tested with</h2><p>There is a difference of opinion over the words that Allah tested Ibrahim with. There are several opinions attributed to Ibn `Abbas. For instance, `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah tested him with the rituals (of Hajj).\" Abu Ishaq reported the same. `Abdur-Razzaq also narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ</div><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim (Abraham) (i.e., Allah) tried him with (certain) commands) means, \"Allah tested him with Taharah (purity, ablution): five on the head and five on the body. As for the head, they are cutting the mustache, rinsing the mouth, inhaling and discarding water, using Siwak and parting the hair. As for the body, they are trimming the nails, shaving the pubic hair, circumcision and plucking under the arm and washing with water after answering the call of nature.\" Ibn Abi Hatim said, \"A similar statement was also reported from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, An-Nakha`i, Abu Salih, Abu Al-Jald, and so forth.\" </p><p>There is a similar statement that Imam Muslim narrated from `A'ishah who said that Allah's Messenger said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَشْرٌ مِنَ الْفِطْرَةِ: قَصُّ الشَّارِبِ وَإِعْفَاءُ اللِّحْيَةِ وَالسِّوَاكُ وَاسْتِنْشَاقُ الْمَاءِ وَقَصُّ الْأَظْفَارِ وَغَسْلُ الْبَرَاجِمِ وَنَتْفُ الْإِبْطِ وَحَلْقُ الْعَانَةِ وَانْتِقَاصُ الْمَاءِ وَنَسِيتُ الْعَاشِرَةَ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونَ الْمَضْمَضَة»</div><p>(Ten are among the Fitrah (instinct, natural constitution): trimming the mustache, growing the beard, using Siwak, inhaling and then exhaling water (in ablution), cutting the nails, washing between the fingers (in ablution), plucking the underarm hair, shaving the pubic hair, washing with water after answering the call of nature, (and I forgot the tenth, I think it was) rinsing the mouth (in ablution).) </p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْفِطْرَةُ خَمْسٌ: الْخِتَانُ وَالْاسْتِحْدَادُ وَقَصُّ الشَّارِبِ وَتَقْلِيمُ الْأَظْفَارِ وَنَتْفُ الْإِبْط»</div><p>(Five are among the acts of Fitrah: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the mustache, cutting the nails and plucking the underarm hair.) This is the wording with Muslim. </p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq reportd that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The words that Allah tested Ibrahim with, and that he implemented were: abandoning his (disbelieving) people when Allah commanded him to do so, disputing with Nimrod (king of Babylon) about Allah, being patient when he was thrown in the fire (although this was extremely traumatic) migrating from his homeland when Allah commanded him to do so, patience with the monetary and material demands of hosting guests by Allah's command, and Allah's order for him to slaughter his son. When Allah tested Ibrahim with these words, and he was ready for the major test, Allah said to him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(\"Submit (be a Muslim)!\" He said, \"I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists. \") (2:131) although this meant defying and being apart from the people.\" </p><h2>The Unjust do not qualify for Allah's Promise</h2><p>Allah said that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ذُرِّيَتِى</div><p>(And of my offspring (to make leaders)) and Allah replied, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(My covenant (prophethood) includes not Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers)). </p><p>When Allah made Ibrahim an Imam (Leader for the faithful), he asked Allah that Imams thereafter be chosen from his offspring. Allah accepted his supplication, but told him that there will be unjust people among his offspring and they will not benefit from Allah's promise. Thus, they will neither become Imams nor be imitated (for they will not be righteous). The proof that Ibrahim's supplication to Allah was accepted is that Allah said in Surat Al-`Ankabut (29:27), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(And We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book). </p><p>Hence, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim were from among his offspring, and every Book that Allah revealed was to them. As for Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>((Allah) said, \"My covenant (prophethood) includes not Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers). \") </p><p>Allah mentioned that there are unjust people among the offspring of Ibrahim, and they will not benefit from Allah's promise, nor would they be entrusted with anything, even though they are among the children of Allah's Khalil (intimate friend, Prophet Abraham). There will also be those who do good among the children of Ibrahim, and these it is who will benefit from Ibrahim's supplication. Ibn Jarir said that this Ayah indicated that the unjust shall not be Imams for the people. Moreover, the Ayah informed Ibrahim that there will be unjust people among his offspring. Also, Ibn Khuwayz Mindad Al-Maliki said, \"The unjust person does not qualify to be a Khalifah, a ruler, one who gives religious verdicts, a witness, or even a narrator (of Hadiths).\" </p>"

Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</div><p>(Our Lord!

Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Isma`il was handing him the stones (constructing the Ka`bah).\"As-Suddi said, \"The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Isma`il's wife put under Ibrahim's feet when washing his head.\" Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, \"When the Prophet performed Tawaf, `Umar asked him, `Is this the Maqam of our father' He said, `Yes.' `Umar said, `Should we take it a place of prayer' So Allah revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</div><p>(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.\") </p><p>Al-Bukhari said, \"Chapter: Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</div><p>(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.\" He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.' The Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</div><p>(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, `O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet's wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, `Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.' I advised one of his wives and she said to me, `O `Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him' Allah then revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</div><p>(It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)).\" (66:5) </p><p>Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, \"After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rak`ahs.\" This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn `Umar say, \"The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rak`ahs behind the Maqam.\" </p><p>All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House's walls became higher, Isma`il brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Isma`il handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Isma`il and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn `Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim's footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as `Al-Lamiyyah', \"And Ibrahim's footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.\" </p><p>The Muslims also saw Ibrahim's footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, \"I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim's toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.\" </p><p>Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Ka`bah's wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door. </p><p>When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Ka`bah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Ka`bah's wall during his reign. `Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</div><p>(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and `Umar.) </p><p>`Umar was also the person whom the Qur'an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it. </p><p>`Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from `Ata', \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.\" Also, `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that `Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.\" Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded `A'ishah saying, \"During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. `Umar moved the Maqam during his reign.\" This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration. i </p>"

So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact).) </p><p>Abu Shurayh was asked, `What did `Amr reply' He said, (`Amr said) `O Abu Shurayh! I know better than you about this, the Sacred House does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.' This Hadith was collected by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p>After this, there is no contradiction between the Hadiths that stated that Allah made Makkah a sanctuary when He created the heavens and earth and the Hadiths that Ibrahim made it a sanctuary, since Ibrahim conveyed Allah's decree that Makkah is a sanctuary, before he built the House. Similarly, the Messenger of Allah was written as the Final Prophet when Adam was still clay. Yet, Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَابْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ</div><p>(Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own) (2: 129). </p><p>Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication, although He had full knowledge beforehand that it will occur by His decree. To further elaborate on this subject, we should mention the Hadith about what the Messenger of Allah said when he was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Tell us about how your prophethood started.\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ، وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي كَأَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام»</div><p>(I am the supplication of my father Ibrahim, the good news of Jesus, the son of Mary, and my mother saw a light that radiated from her which illuminated the castles of Ash-Sham (Syria).) </p><p>In this Hadith, the Companions asked the Messenger about the beginning of his prophethood. We will explain this matter later, if Allah wills. </p><h2>Ibrahim invokes Allah to make Makkah an Area of Safety and Sustenance</h2><p>Allah said that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security) (2:126) from terror, so that its people do not suffer from fear. Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</div><p>(Whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:97) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them) (29:67). </p><p>We have already mentioned the Hadiths that prohibit fighting in the Sacred Area. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحِلُّ لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يَحْمِلَ بِمَكَّةَ السِّلَاح»</div><p>(No one is allowed to carry weapons in Makkah.) Allah mentioned that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security) meaning, make this a safe city. This occurred before the Ka`bah was built. Allah said in Surat Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</div><p>(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, \"My Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security...\") (14:35) as here, Ibrahim supplicated a second time after the House was built and its people lived around it, after Ishaq who was thirteen years Isma`il's junior was born. This is why at the end of his supplication, Ibrahim said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ </div><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Verily, my Lord is indeed the Hearer of invocations) (14:39). </p><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَارْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ الثَّمَرَتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَى عَذَابِ النَّارِ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(\"...and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.\" He (Allah) answered: \"As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!\") </p><p>Ibn Jarir said that Ubayy bin Ka`b commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَى عَذَابِ النَّارِ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(He answered: \"As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!\") \"These are Allah's Words (meaning not Ibrahim's)\" This is also the Tafsir of Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Furthermore, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا وَارْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ الثَّمَرَتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.) \"Ibrahim asked Allah to grant sustenance for the believers only. However, Allah revealed, `I will also provide for the disbelievers, just as I shall provide for the believers. Would I create something and not sustain and provide for I shall allow the disbelievers little delight, and then force them to the torment of the Fire, and what an evil destination.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلاًّ نُّمِدُّ هَـؤُلاءِ وَهَـؤُلاءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُورًا </div><p>(On each these as well as those We bestow from the bounties of your Lord. And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden) (17:20). </p><p>This was recorded by Ibn Marduwyah, who also recorded similar statements from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah will never be successful.

To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allah is the Knower of what is in the breasts (of men). We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.) (31:23-24) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ - وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ أَبْوَباً وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ - وَزُخْرُفاً وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community (all disbelievers desiring worldly life only), We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allah), silver roofs for their houses, and elevators whereby they ascend.

And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for the Muttaqin (the pious).) (43:33-35).

This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing.

There is an authentic Hadith narrated by `A'ishah on this subject, which we will mention later, Allah willing. </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Prophet Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother and went away with them until he reached the area of the House, where he left them next to a tree above Zamzam in the upper area of the Masjid. During that time, Isma`il's mother was still nursing him. Makkah was then uninhabited, and there was no water source in it. Ibrahim left them there with a bag containing some dates and a water-skin containing water. Ibrahim then started to leave, and Isma`il's mother followed him and said, `O Ibrahim! To whom are you leaving us in this barren valley that is not inhabited' She repeated the question several times and Ibrahim did not reply. She asked, `Has Allah commanded you to do this' He said, `Yes.' She said, `I am satisfied that Allah will never abandon us.' Ibrahim left, and when he was far enough away where they could not see him, close to Thaniyyah, he faced the House, raised his hands and supplicated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّى أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِى بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِى زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ</div><p>(O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah)) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(Give thanks) (14:37). Isma`il's mother then returned to her place, started drinking water from the water-skin and nursing Isma`il. When the water was used up, she and her son became thirsty. She looked at him, and he was suffering from thirst; she left, because she disliked seeing his face in that condition. She found the nearest mountian to where she was, As-Safa, ascended it and looked, in vain, hoping to see somebody. When she came down to the valley, she raised her garment and ran, just as a tired person runs, until she reached the Al-Marwah mountain. In vain, she looked to see if there was someone there. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) seven times.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"This is why the people make the trip between As-Safa and Al-Marwah (during Hajj and Umrah).\" </p><p>\"When she reached Al-Marwah, she heard a voice and said, `Shush,' to herself. She tried to hear the voice again and when she did, she said, `I have heard you. Do you have relief' She found the angel digging with his heel (or his wing) where Zamzam now exists, and the water gushed out. Isma`il's mother was astonished and started digging, using her hand to transfer water to the water-skin.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet then said, \"May Allah grant His mercy to the mother of Isma`il, had she left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.\" </p><p>\"Isma`il's mother started drinking the water and her milk increased for her child. The angel (Gabriel) said to her, `Do not fear abandonment. There shall be a House for Allah built here by this boy and his father. Allah does not abandon His people.' During that time, the area of the House was raised above ground level and the floods used to reach its right and left sides. </p><p>Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, passing through Kada', made camp at the bottom of the valley. They saw some birds, they were astonished, and said, `Birds can only be found at a place where there is water. We did not notice before that this valley had water.' They sent a scout or two who searched the area, found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to Isma`il's mother, next to the water, and said, `O Mother of Isma`il! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)' She said, `Yes. But you will have no exclusive right to the water here.' They said, `We agree.\"' Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet said, \"At that time, Isma`il's mother liked to have human company.\" </p><p>\"And thus they stayed there and sent for their relatives to join them. Later on, her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them, for Isma`il learned Arabic from them, and they liked the way he was raised. Isma`il's mother died after that. </p><p>Then an idea occurred to Abraham to visit his dependents. So he left (to Makkah). When he arrived, he did not find Isma`il, so he asked his wife about him. She said, `He has gone out hunting.' When he asked her about their living conditions, she complained to him that they live in misery and poverty. Abraham said (to her), `When your husband comes, convey my greeting and tell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came, he sensed that they had a visitor and asked his wife, `Did we have a visitor' She said, `Yes. An old man came to visit us and asked me about you, and I told him where you were. He also asked about our condition, and I told him that we live in hardship and poverty.' Isma`il said, `Did he ask you to do anything' She said, `Yes. He asked me to convey his greeting and that you should change the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said to her, `He was my father and you are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' So he divorced her and married another woman. Again Ibrahim thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Makkah). Ibrahim came to Isma`il's house, but did not find Isma`il and asked his wife, `Where is Isma`il' Isma`il's wife replied, `He has gone out hunting.' He asked her about their condition, and she said that they have a good life and praised Allah. Ibrahim asked, `What is your food and what is your drink' She replied, `Our food is meat and our drink is water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and their drink.\"' The Prophet (Muhammad ) said, \"They did not have crops then, otherwise Ibrahim would have invoked Allah to bless that too. Those who do not live in Makkah cannot bear eating a diet only containing meat and water.\" </p><p>\"Ibrahim said, `When Isma`il comes back, convey my greeting to him and ask him to keep the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came back, he asked, `Has anyone visited us.' She said, `Yes. A good looking old man,' and she praised Ibrahim, `And he asked me about our livelihood and I told him that we live in good conditions.' He asked, `Did he ask you to convey any message' She said, `Yes. He conveyed his greeting to you and said that you should keep the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said, `That was my father, and you are the threshold; he commanded me to keep you.' </p><p>Ibrahim then came back visiting and found Isma`il behind the Zamzam well, next to a tree, mending his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he stood up and they greeted each other, just as the father and son greet each other. Ibrahim said, `O Isma`il, Your Lord has ordered me to do something.' He said, `Obey your Lord.' He asked Isma`il, `Will you help me' He said, `Yes, I will help you.' Ibrahim said, `Allah has commanded me to build a house for Him there, ' and he pointed to an area that was above ground level. So, both of them rose and started to raise the foundations of the House. Abraham started building (the Ka`bah), while Isma`il continued handing him the stones. Both of them were saying, `O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.' (2.127).\"' Hence, they were building the House, part by part, going around it and saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the Hearer, the Knower.) </p><h2>The Story of rebuilding the House by Quraysh before the Messenger of Allah was sent as Prophet</h2><p>In his Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, \"When the Messenger of Allah reached thirty-five years of age, the Quraysh gathered to rebuild the Ka`bah, this included covering it with a roof. However, they were weary of demolishing it. During that time, the Ka`bah was barely above a man's shoulder, so they wanted to raise its height and build a ceiling on top. Some people had stolen the Ka`bah's treasure beforehand, which used to be in a well in the middle of the Ka`bah. The treasure was later found with a man called, Duwayk, a freed servant of Bani Mulayh bin `Amr, from the tribe of Khuza`ah. The Quraysh cut off his hand as punishment. Some people claimed that those who actually stole the treasure left it with Duwayk. Afterwards, the sea brought a ship that belonged to a Roman merchant to the shores of Jeddah, where it washed-up. So they collected the ship's wood to use it for the Ka`bah's ceiling; a Coptic carpenter in Makkah prepared what they needed for the job. When they decided to begin the demolition process to rebuild the House, Abu Wahb bin `Amr bin `A'idh bin `Abd bin `Imran bin Makhzum took a stone from the Ka`bah; the stone slipped from his hand and went back to where it had been. He said, `O people of Quraysh! Do not spend on rebuilding the House, except from what was earned from pure sources. No money earned from a prostitute, usury or injustice should be included.\"' Ibn Ishaq commented here that the people also attribute these words to Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq continued, \"The Quraysh began to organize their efforts to rebuild the Ka`bah, each subtribe taking the responsibility of rebuilding a designated part of it. </p><p>However, they were still weary about bringing down the Ka`bah. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said, `I will start to bring it down.' He held an ax and stood by the Ka`bah and said, `O Allah! No harm is meant. O Allah! We only seek to do a good service.' He then started to chop the House's stones. The people waited that night and said, `We will wait and see. If something strikes him, we will not bring it down and instead rebuid it the way it was. If nothing happens to him, then Allah will have agreed to what we are doing.' The next morning, Al-Walid went to work on the Ka`bah, and the people started bringing the Ka`bah down with him. When they reached the foundations that Ibrahim built, they uncovered green stones that were above each other, just like a pile of spears.\" Ibn Ishaq then said that some people told him, \"A man from Quraysh, who was helping rebuild the Ka`bah, placed the shovel between two of these stones to pull them up; when one of the stones was moved, all of Makkah shook, so they did not dig up these stones.\" </p><h2>The Dispute regarding Who should place the Black Stone in Its Place</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"The tribes of Quraysh collected stones to rebuild the House, each tribe collecting on their own. They started rebuilding it, until the rebuilding of the Ka`bah reached the point where the Black Stone was to be placed in its designated site. A dispute erupted between the various tribes of Quraysh, each seeking the honor of placing the Black Stone for their own tribe. The dispute almost led to violence between the leaders of Quraysh in the area of the Sacred House. Banu `Abd Ad-Dar and Banu `Adi bin Ka`b bin Lu'ay, gave their mutual pledge to fight until death. However, five or four days later, Abu Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum, the oldest man from Quraysh then intervened at the right moment. Abu Umayyah suggested that Quraysh should appoint the first man to enter the House from its entrance to be a mediator between them. They agreed. </p><p>The Messenger - Muhammad - was the first person to enter the House. When the various leaders of Quraysh realized who the first one was, they all proclaimed, `This is Al-Amin (the Honest one). We all accept him; This is Muhammad.' When the Prophet reached the area where the leaders were gathering and they informed him about their dispute, he asked them to bring a garment and place it on the ground. He placed the Black Stone on it. He then requested that each of the leaders of Quraysh hold the garment from one side and all participate in lifting the Black Stone, moving it to its designated area. Next, the Prophet carried the Black Stone by himself and placed it in its designated position and built around it. The Quraysh used to call the Messenger of Allah `Al-Amin' even before the revelation came to him.\" </p><h2>Ibn Az-Zubayr rebuilds Al-Ka`bah the way the Prophet wished</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"During the time of the Prophet , the Ka`bah was eighteen cubits high and was covered with Egyptian linen, and they with a striped garment. Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf was the first person to cover it with silk.\" The Ka`bah remained the same way the Quraysh rebuilt it, until it was burned during the reign of `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, after the year 6o H, at the end of the reign of Yazل0d bin Mu`awiyah. During that time, Ibn Az-Zubayr was besieged at Makkah. When it was burned, Ibn Az-Zubayr brought the Ka`bah down and built it upon the foundations of Ibrahim, including the Hijr in it. He also made an eastern door and a western door in the Ka`bah and placed them on ground level. He had heard his aunt `A'ishah, the Mother of the believers, narrate that the Messenger of Allah had wished that. The Ka`bah remained like this throughout his reign, until Al-Hajjaj killed Ibn Az-Zubayr and then rebuilt it the way it was before, by the order of `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. </p><p>Muslim recorded that `Ata' said, \"The House was burnt during the reign of Yazid bin Mu`awiyah, when the people of Ash-Sham raided Makkah. Ibn Az-Zubayr did not touch the House until the people came for Hajj, for he wanted to incite them against the people of Ash-Sham. He said to them, `O people! Advise me regarding the Ka`bah, should we bring it down and rebuild it, or just repair the damage it sustained' Ibn `Abbas said, `I have an opinion about this. You should rebuild the House the way it was when the people became Muslims. You should leave the stones that existed when the people became Muslims and when the Prophet was sent. ' Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `If the house of one of them gets burned, he will not be satisfied, until he rebuilds it. How about Allah's House I will invoke my Lord for three days and will then implement what I decide.' When the three days had passed, he decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. They brought the House down to ground level. Ibn Az-Zubayr surrounded the site with curtains hanging from pillars, so that the House would be covered, until the building was erect. Ibn Az-Zubayr then said, `I heard `A'ishah say that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا أَنَّ النَّاسَ حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ بِكُفْرٍ، وَلَيْسَ عِنْدِي مِنَ النَّفَقَةِ مَا يُقَوِّينِي عَلى بِنَائِهِ لَكُنْتُ أَدْخَلْتُ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحِجْرِ خَمْسَةَ أَذْرُعٍ، وَلَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ بَابًا يَدْخُلُ النَّاسُ مِنْهُ وَبَابًا يَخْرُجُونَ مِنْه»</div><p>(If it was not for the fact that the people have recently abandoned disbelief, and that I do not have enough money to spend on it, I would have included in the House five cubits from Al-Hijr and would have made a door for it that people could enter from, and another door that they could exit from.) </p><p>Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `I can spend on this job, and I do not fear the people.' So he added five cubits from the Hijr, which looked like a rear part for the House that people could clearly see. He then built the House and made it eighteen cubits high. He thought that the House was still short and added ten cubits in the front and built two doors in it, one as an entrance and another as an exit. </p><p>When Ibn Az-Zubayr was killed, Al-Hajjaj wrote to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan asking him about the House and told him that Ibn Az-Zubayr made a rear section for the House. `Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions. As, for the Ka`bah's height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.' Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was.\" In his Sunan, An-Nasa'i collected the Hadith of the Prophet narrated from `A'ishah, not the whole story, </p><p>The correct Sunnah conformed to Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions, because this was what the Prophet wished he could do, but feared that the hearts of the people who recently became Muslim could not bear rebuilding the House. This Sunnah was not clear to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. Hence, when `Abdul-Malik realized that `A'ishah had narrated the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah on this subject, he said, \"I wish we had left it as Ibn Az-Zubayr had made it.\" Muslim recorded that `Ubadydullah bin `Ubayd said that Al-Harith bin `Abdullah came to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan during his reign. `Abdul-Malik said, `I did not think that Abu Khubayb (Ibn Az-Zubayr) heard from `A'ishah what he said he heard from her.' Al-Harith said, `Yes he did. I heard the Hadith from her.' `Abdul-Malik said, `You heard her say what' He said, `She said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ قَوْمَكِ اسْتَقْصَرُوا مِنْ بُنْيَانِ الْبَيْتِ وَلَوْلَا حَدَاثَةُ عَهْدِهِمْ بِالشِّرْكِ أَعَدْتُ مَا تَرَكُوا مِنْهُ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لِقَوْمِكِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَنْ يَبْنُوهُ فَهَلُمِّي لِأُرِيَكِ مَا تَرَكُوهُ مِنْه»</div><p>(Your people rebuilt the House smaller.

He showed her around seven cubits.' </p><p>One of the narrators of the Hadith, Al-Walid bin `Ata', added that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَلَجَعَلْتُ لَهَا بَابَيْنِ مَوْضُوعَيْنِ فِي الْأَرْضِ: شَرْقِيًّا وَغَرْبِيًّا، وَهَلْ تَدرِينَ لِمَ كَانَ قَومُكِ رَفَعُوا بَابَهَا؟»</div><p>قَالَتْ: قُلْتُ: لَا. قَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَعَزُّزًا أَنْ لَا يَدْخُلَهَا إِلَّا مَنْ أَرَادُوا، فَكَانَ الرَّجُلُ إِذَا هُوَ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَدْخُلَهَا يَدَعُونَهُ يَرْتَقِي حَتَّى إِذَا كَادَ أَنْ يَدْخُلَ دَفَعُوهُ فَسَقَط»</div><p>(I would have made two doors for the House on ground level, one eastern and one western.

When a man whom they did not wish to enter the House climbed to the level of the door, they would push him down) </p><p>`Abdul-Malik then said, `You heard `A'ishah say this Hadith' He said, `Yes.' `Abdul-Malik said, `I wish I left it as it was.\" </p><h2>An Ethiopian will destroy the Ka`bah just before the Last Hour</h2><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُخَرِّبُ الْكَعْبَةَ ذُو السُّوَيْقَتَيْنِ مِنَ الْحَبَشَة»</div><p>(The Ka`bah will be destroyed by Dhus-Sawiqatayn (literally, a person with two lean legs) from Ethiopia.) </p><p>Also, Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَأَنِّي بِهِ أَسْوَدَ أَفْحَجَ يَقْلَعُهَا حَجَرًا حَجَرًا»</div><p>(As if I see him now: a black person with thin legs plucking the stones of the Ka`bah one after another.)

Jibril said, `Say Takbir (Allah is the Great) and throw (pebbles) at him.' Ibrahim said the Takbir and threw (pebbles at) Iblis. Iblis moved to the middle Jamrah, and when Jibril and Ibrahim passed by him, Jibril said to Ibrahim, `Say Takbir and throw at him.' Ibrahim threw at him and said Takbir. The devious Iblis sought to add some evil acts to the rituals of Hajj, but he was unable to succeed. Jibril took Ibrahim's hand and led him to Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram and `Arafat and said to him, `Have you `Arafta (known, learned) what I showed you' thrice.

I have made what is between the two sides of Al-Madinah a Sacred Area. Therefore, its game should not be hunted, and its trees should not be cut.) An-Nasa'i and Muslim also recorded this Hadith. </p><p>There are several other Hadiths that indicate that Allah made Makkah a sacred area before He created the heavens and earth. The Two Sahihs recorded `Abdullah bin `Abbas saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَومِ الْقِيَامَةِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَحِلَّ الْقِتَالُ فِيهِ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي وَلَمْ يَحِلَّ لِي إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يُعْضَدُ شَوْكُهُ وَلَا يُنَفَّرُ صَيْدُهُ،وَلَا يَلْتَقِطُ لُقَطَتَهُ إِلَّا مَنْ عَرَّفَهَا وَلَا يُخْتَلى خَلَاهَا»</div><p>فَقَالَ الْعَبَّاسُ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ: إِلّا الْإذْخِرَ فَإِنَّهُ لِقَيْنِهِمْ وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ فَقَالَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِلَّا الْإِذْخِر»</div><p>(Allah has made this city a sanctuary (sacred place) the Day He created the heavens and earth.

Therefore, it is a sanctuary until the Day of Resurrection, because Allah made it a sanctuary. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs, or to chase its game, or to pick up something that has fallen, except by a person who announces it publicly, nor should any of its trees be cut.) Al-`Abbas said, `O Messenger of Allah! Except the lemon-grass, for our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet added, (Except lemon-grass.) </p><p>This is the wording of Muslim. The Two Sahihs also recorded Abu Hurayrah narrating a similar Hadith, while Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith from Safiyyah bint Shaybah who narrated it from the Prophet . </p><p>Abu Shurayh Al-`Adawi said that he said to `Amr bin Sa`id while he was sending armies to Makkah, \"O Commander! Let me narrate a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah said the day that followed the victory of Makkah. My ears heard the Hadith, my heart comprehended it, and my eyes saw the Prophet when he said it.

Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the Conquest), and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact).) </p><p>Abu Shurayh was asked, `What did `Amr reply' He said, (`Amr said) `O Abu Shurayh! I know better than you about this, the Sacred House does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.' This Hadith was collected by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p>After this, there is no contradiction between the Hadiths that stated that Allah made Makkah a sanctuary when He created the heavens and earth and the Hadiths that Ibrahim made it a sanctuary, since Ibrahim conveyed Allah's decree that Makkah is a sanctuary, before he built the House. Similarly, the Messenger of Allah was written as the Final Prophet when Adam was still clay. Yet, Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَابْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ</div><p>(Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own) (2: 129). </p><p>Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication, although He had full knowledge beforehand that it will occur by His decree. To further elaborate on this subject, we should mention the Hadith about what the Messenger of Allah said when he was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Tell us about how your prophethood started.\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ، وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي كَأَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام»</div><p>(I am the supplication of my father Ibrahim, the good news of Jesus, the son of Mary, and my mother saw a light that radiated from her which illuminated the castles of Ash-Sham (Syria).) </p><p>In this Hadith, the Companions asked the Messenger about the beginning of his prophethood. We will explain this matter later, if Allah wills. </p><h2>Ibrahim invokes Allah to make Makkah an Area of Safety and Sustenance</h2><p>Allah said that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security) (2:126) from terror, so that its people do not suffer from fear. Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</div><p>(Whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:97) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them) (29:67). </p><p>We have already mentioned the Hadiths that prohibit fighting in the Sacred Area. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحِلُّ لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يَحْمِلَ بِمَكَّةَ السِّلَاح»</div><p>(No one is allowed to carry weapons in Makkah.)

This occurred before the Ka`bah was built.

Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security...\") (14:35) as here, Ibrahim supplicated a second time after the House was built and its people lived around it, after Ishaq who was thirteen years Isma`il's junior was born. This is why at the end of his supplication, Ibrahim said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ </div><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac).

This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing.

There is an authentic Hadith narrated by `A'ishah on this subject, which we will mention later, Allah willing. </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Prophet Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother and went away with them until he reached the area of the House, where he left them next to a tree above Zamzam in the upper area of the Masjid. During that time, Isma`il's mother was still nursing him. Makkah was then uninhabited, and there was no water source in it. Ibrahim left them there with a bag containing some dates and a water-skin containing water. Ibrahim then started to leave, and Isma`il's mother followed him and said, `O Ibrahim! To whom are you leaving us in this barren valley that is not inhabited' She repeated the question several times and Ibrahim did not reply. She asked, `Has Allah commanded you to do this' He said, `Yes.' She said, `I am satisfied that Allah will never abandon us.' Ibrahim left, and when he was far enough away where they could not see him, close to Thaniyyah, he faced the House, raised his hands and supplicated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّى أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِى بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِى زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ</div><p>(O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah)) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(Give thanks) (14:37). Isma`il's mother then returned to her place, started drinking water from the water-skin and nursing Isma`il. When the water was used up, she and her son became thirsty. She looked at him, and he was suffering from thirst; she left, because she disliked seeing his face in that condition. She found the nearest mountian to where she was, As-Safa, ascended it and looked, in vain, hoping to see somebody. When she came down to the valley, she raised her garment and ran, just as a tired person runs, until she reached the Al-Marwah mountain. In vain, she looked to see if there was someone there. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) seven times.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"This is why the people make the trip between As-Safa and Al-Marwah (during Hajj and Umrah).\" </p><p>\"When she reached Al-Marwah, she heard a voice and said, `Shush,' to herself. She tried to hear the voice again and when she did, she said, `I have heard you. Do you have relief' She found the angel digging with his heel (or his wing) where Zamzam now exists, and the water gushed out. Isma`il's mother was astonished and started digging, using her hand to transfer water to the water-skin.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet then said, \"May Allah grant His mercy to the mother of Isma`il, had she left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.\" </p><p>\"Isma`il's mother started drinking the water and her milk increased for her child. The angel (Gabriel) said to her, `Do not fear abandonment. There shall be a House for Allah built here by this boy and his father. Allah does not abandon His people.' During that time, the area of the House was raised above ground level and the floods used to reach its right and left sides. </p><p>Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, passing through Kada', made camp at the bottom of the valley. They saw some birds, they were astonished, and said, `Birds can only be found at a place where there is water. We did not notice before that this valley had water.' They sent a scout or two who searched the area, found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to Isma`il's mother, next to the water, and said, `O Mother of Isma`il! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)' She said, `Yes. But you will have no exclusive right to the water here.' They said, `We agree.\"' Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet said, \"At that time, Isma`il's mother liked to have human company.\" </p><p>\"And thus they stayed there and sent for their relatives to join them. Later on, her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them, for Isma`il learned Arabic from them, and they liked the way he was raised. Isma`il's mother died after that. </p><p>Then an idea occurred to Abraham to visit his dependents. So he left (to Makkah). When he arrived, he did not find Isma`il, so he asked his wife about him. She said, `He has gone out hunting.' When he asked her about their living conditions, she complained to him that they live in misery and poverty. Abraham said (to her), `When your husband comes, convey my greeting and tell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came, he sensed that they had a visitor and asked his wife, `Did we have a visitor' She said, `Yes. An old man came to visit us and asked me about you, and I told him where you were. He also asked about our condition, and I told him that we live in hardship and poverty.' Isma`il said, `Did he ask you to do anything' She said, `Yes. He asked me to convey his greeting and that you should change the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said to her, `He was my father and you are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' So he divorced her and married another woman. Again Ibrahim thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Makkah). Ibrahim came to Isma`il's house, but did not find Isma`il and asked his wife, `Where is Isma`il' Isma`il's wife replied, `He has gone out hunting.' He asked her about their condition, and she said that they have a good life and praised Allah. Ibrahim asked, `What is your food and what is your drink' She replied, `Our food is meat and our drink is water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and their drink.\"' The Prophet (Muhammad ) said, \"They did not have crops then, otherwise Ibrahim would have invoked Allah to bless that too. Those who do not live in Makkah cannot bear eating a diet only containing meat and water.\" </p><p>\"Ibrahim said, `When Isma`il comes back, convey my greeting to him and ask him to keep the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came back, he asked, `Has anyone visited us.' She said, `Yes. A good looking old man,' and she praised Ibrahim, `And he asked me about our livelihood and I told him that we live in good conditions.' He asked, `Did he ask you to convey any message' She said, `Yes. He conveyed his greeting to you and said that you should keep the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said, `That was my father, and you are the threshold; he commanded me to keep you.' </p><p>Ibrahim then came back visiting and found Isma`il behind the Zamzam well, next to a tree, mending his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he stood up and they greeted each other, just as the father and son greet each other. Ibrahim said, `O Isma`il, Your Lord has ordered me to do something.' He said, `Obey your Lord.' He asked Isma`il, `Will you help me' He said, `Yes, I will help you.' Ibrahim said, `Allah has commanded me to build a house for Him there, ' and he pointed to an area that was above ground level. So, both of them rose and started to raise the foundations of the House. Abraham started building (the Ka`bah), while Isma`il continued handing him the stones. Both of them were saying, `O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.' (2.127).\"' Hence, they were building the House, part by part, going around it and saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the Hearer, the Knower.) </p><h2>The Story of rebuilding the House by Quraysh before the Messenger of Allah was sent as Prophet</h2><p>In his Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, \"When the Messenger of Allah reached thirty-five years of age, the Quraysh gathered to rebuild the Ka`bah, this included covering it with a roof. However, they were weary of demolishing it. During that time, the Ka`bah was barely above a man's shoulder, so they wanted to raise its height and build a ceiling on top. Some people had stolen the Ka`bah's treasure beforehand, which used to be in a well in the middle of the Ka`bah. The treasure was later found with a man called, Duwayk, a freed servant of Bani Mulayh bin `Amr, from the tribe of Khuza`ah. The Quraysh cut off his hand as punishment. Some people claimed that those who actually stole the treasure left it with Duwayk. Afterwards, the sea brought a ship that belonged to a Roman merchant to the shores of Jeddah, where it washed-up. So they collected the ship's wood to use it for the Ka`bah's ceiling; a Coptic carpenter in Makkah prepared what they needed for the job. When they decided to begin the demolition process to rebuild the House, Abu Wahb bin `Amr bin `A'idh bin `Abd bin `Imran bin Makhzum took a stone from the Ka`bah; the stone slipped from his hand and went back to where it had been. He said, `O people of Quraysh! Do not spend on rebuilding the House, except from what was earned from pure sources. No money earned from a prostitute, usury or injustice should be included.\"' Ibn Ishaq commented here that the people also attribute these words to Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq continued, \"The Quraysh began to organize their efforts to rebuild the Ka`bah, each subtribe taking the responsibility of rebuilding a designated part of it. </p><p>However, they were still weary about bringing down the Ka`bah. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said, `I will start to bring it down.' He held an ax and stood by the Ka`bah and said, `O Allah! No harm is meant. O Allah! We only seek to do a good service.' He then started to chop the House's stones. The people waited that night and said, `We will wait and see. If something strikes him, we will not bring it down and instead rebuid it the way it was. If nothing happens to him, then Allah will have agreed to what we are doing.' The next morning, Al-Walid went to work on the Ka`bah, and the people started bringing the Ka`bah down with him. When they reached the foundations that Ibrahim built, they uncovered green stones that were above each other, just like a pile of spears.\" Ibn Ishaq then said that some people told him, \"A man from Quraysh, who was helping rebuild the Ka`bah, placed the shovel between two of these stones to pull them up; when one of the stones was moved, all of Makkah shook, so they did not dig up these stones.\" </p><h2>The Dispute regarding Who should place the Black Stone in Its Place</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"The tribes of Quraysh collected stones to rebuild the House, each tribe collecting on their own. They started rebuilding it, until the rebuilding of the Ka`bah reached the point where the Black Stone was to be placed in its designated site. A dispute erupted between the various tribes of Quraysh, each seeking the honor of placing the Black Stone for their own tribe. The dispute almost led to violence between the leaders of Quraysh in the area of the Sacred House. Banu `Abd Ad-Dar and Banu `Adi bin Ka`b bin Lu'ay, gave their mutual pledge to fight until death. However, five or four days later, Abu Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum, the oldest man from Quraysh then intervened at the right moment. Abu Umayyah suggested that Quraysh should appoint the first man to enter the House from its entrance to be a mediator between them. They agreed. </p><p>The Messenger - Muhammad - was the first person to enter the House. When the various leaders of Quraysh realized who the first one was, they all proclaimed, `This is Al-Amin (the Honest one). We all accept him; This is Muhammad.' When the Prophet reached the area where the leaders were gathering and they informed him about their dispute, he asked them to bring a garment and place it on the ground. He placed the Black Stone on it. He then requested that each of the leaders of Quraysh hold the garment from one side and all participate in lifting the Black Stone, moving it to its designated area. Next, the Prophet carried the Black Stone by himself and placed it in its designated position and built around it. The Quraysh used to call the Messenger of Allah `Al-Amin' even before the revelation came to him.\" </p><h2>Ibn Az-Zubayr rebuilds Al-Ka`bah the way the Prophet wished</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"During the time of the Prophet , the Ka`bah was eighteen cubits high and was covered with Egyptian linen, and they with a striped garment. Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf was the first person to cover it with silk.\" The Ka`bah remained the same way the Quraysh rebuilt it, until it was burned during the reign of `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, after the year 6o H, at the end of the reign of Yazل0d bin Mu`awiyah. During that time, Ibn Az-Zubayr was besieged at Makkah. When it was burned, Ibn Az-Zubayr brought the Ka`bah down and built it upon the foundations of Ibrahim, including the Hijr in it. He also made an eastern door and a western door in the Ka`bah and placed them on ground level. He had heard his aunt `A'ishah, the Mother of the believers, narrate that the Messenger of Allah had wished that. The Ka`bah remained like this throughout his reign, until Al-Hajjaj killed Ibn Az-Zubayr and then rebuilt it the way it was before, by the order of `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. </p><p>Muslim recorded that `Ata' said, \"The House was burnt during the reign of Yazid bin Mu`awiyah, when the people of Ash-Sham raided Makkah. Ibn Az-Zubayr did not touch the House until the people came for Hajj, for he wanted to incite them against the people of Ash-Sham. He said to them, `O people! Advise me regarding the Ka`bah, should we bring it down and rebuild it, or just repair the damage it sustained' Ibn `Abbas said, `I have an opinion about this. You should rebuild the House the way it was when the people became Muslims. You should leave the stones that existed when the people became Muslims and when the Prophet was sent. ' Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `If the house of one of them gets burned, he will not be satisfied, until he rebuilds it. How about Allah's House I will invoke my Lord for three days and will then implement what I decide.' When the three days had passed, he decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. They brought the House down to ground level. Ibn Az-Zubayr surrounded the site with curtains hanging from pillars, so that the House would be covered, until the building was erect. Ibn Az-Zubayr then said, `I heard `A'ishah say that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا أَنَّ النَّاسَ حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ بِكُفْرٍ، وَلَيْسَ عِنْدِي مِنَ النَّفَقَةِ مَا يُقَوِّينِي عَلى بِنَائِهِ لَكُنْتُ أَدْخَلْتُ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحِجْرِ خَمْسَةَ أَذْرُعٍ، وَلَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ بَابًا يَدْخُلُ النَّاسُ مِنْهُ وَبَابًا يَخْرُجُونَ مِنْه»</div><p>(If it was not for the fact that the people have recently abandoned disbelief, and that I do not have enough money to spend on it, I would have included in the House five cubits from Al-Hijr and would have made a door for it that people could enter from, and another door that they could exit from.) </p><p>Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `I can spend on this job, and I do not fear the people.' So he added five cubits from the Hijr, which looked like a rear part for the House that people could clearly see. He then built the House and made it eighteen cubits high. He thought that the House was still short and added ten cubits in the front and built two doors in it, one as an entrance and another as an exit. </p><p>When Ibn Az-Zubayr was killed, Al-Hajjaj wrote to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan asking him about the House and told him that Ibn Az-Zubayr made a rear section for the House. `Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions. As, for the Ka`bah's height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.' Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was.\" In his Sunan, An-Nasa'i collected the Hadith of the Prophet narrated from `A'ishah, not the whole story, </p><p>The correct Sunnah conformed to Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions, because this was what the Prophet wished he could do, but feared that the hearts of the people who recently became Muslim could not bear rebuilding the House. This Sunnah was not clear to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. Hence, when `Abdul-Malik realized that `A'ishah had narrated the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah on this subject, he said, \"I wish we had left it as Ibn Az-Zubayr had made it.\" Muslim recorded that `Ubadydullah bin `Ubayd said that Al-Harith bin `Abdullah came to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan during his reign. `Abdul-Malik said, `I did not think that Abu Khubayb (Ibn Az-Zubayr) heard from `A'ishah what he said he heard from her.' Al-Harith said, `Yes he did. I heard the Hadith from her.' `Abdul-Malik said, `You heard her say what' He said, `She said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ قَوْمَكِ اسْتَقْصَرُوا مِنْ بُنْيَانِ الْبَيْتِ وَلَوْلَا حَدَاثَةُ عَهْدِهِمْ بِالشِّرْكِ أَعَدْتُ مَا تَرَكُوا مِنْهُ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لِقَوْمِكِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَنْ يَبْنُوهُ فَهَلُمِّي لِأُرِيَكِ مَا تَرَكُوهُ مِنْه»</div><p>(Your people rebuilt the House smaller.

Iblis moved to the middle Jamrah, and when Jibril and Ibrahim passed by him, Jibril said to Ibrahim, `Say Takbir and throw at him.' Ibrahim threw at him and said Takbir. The devious Iblis sought to add some evil acts to the rituals of Hajj, but he was unable to succeed. Jibril took Ibrahim's hand and led him to Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram and `Arafat and said to him, `Have you `Arafta (known, learned) what I showed you' thrice.

I have made what is between the two sides of Al-Madinah a Sacred Area. Therefore, its game should not be hunted, and its trees should not be cut.) An-Nasa'i and Muslim also recorded this Hadith. </p><p>There are several other Hadiths that indicate that Allah made Makkah a sacred area before He created the heavens and earth. The Two Sahihs recorded `Abdullah bin `Abbas saying that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَومِ الْقِيَامَةِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَحِلَّ الْقِتَالُ فِيهِ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي وَلَمْ يَحِلَّ لِي إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يُعْضَدُ شَوْكُهُ وَلَا يُنَفَّرُ صَيْدُهُ،وَلَا يَلْتَقِطُ لُقَطَتَهُ إِلَّا مَنْ عَرَّفَهَا وَلَا يُخْتَلى خَلَاهَا»</div><p>فَقَالَ الْعَبَّاسُ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ: إِلّا الْإذْخِرَ فَإِنَّهُ لِقَيْنِهِمْ وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ فَقَالَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِلَّا الْإِذْخِر»</div><p>(Allah has made this city a sanctuary (sacred place) the Day He created the heavens and earth. Therefore, it is a sanctuary until the Day of Resurrection because Allah made it a sanctuary. It was not legal for anyone to fight in it before me, and it was legal for me for a few hours of one day. Therefore, it is a sanctuary until the Day of Resurrection, because Allah made it a sanctuary. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs, or to chase its game, or to pick up something that has fallen, except by a person who announces it publicly, nor should any of its trees be cut.) Al-`Abbas said, `O Messenger of Allah! Except the lemon-grass, for our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet added, (Except lemon-grass.) </p><p>This is the wording of Muslim. The Two Sahihs also recorded Abu Hurayrah narrating a similar Hadith, while Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith from Safiyyah bint Shaybah who narrated it from the Prophet . </p><p>Abu Shurayh Al-`Adawi said that he said to `Amr bin Sa`id while he was sending armies to Makkah, \"O Commander! Let me narrate a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah said the day that followed the victory of Makkah. My ears heard the Hadith, my heart comprehended it, and my eyes saw the Prophet when he said it. He thanked Allah and praised him and then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ مَكَّةَ حَرَّمَهَا اللهُ وَلَمْ يُحَرِّمْهَا النَّاسُ فَلَا يَحِلُّ لِامْرِىءٍ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللهِ وَالْيَومِ الْآخِرِ أَنْ يَسْفِكَ بِهَا دَمًا وَلَا يَعْضِدَ بِهَا شَجَرَةً،فَإِنْ أَحَدٌ تَرَخَّصَ بِقِتَالِ رَسُولِ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم فَقُولُوا: إِنَّ اللهَ أَذِنَ لِرَسُولِهِ وَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لَكُمْ، وَإِنَّمَا أَذِنَ لِي فِيهَا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ وَقَدْ عَادَتْ حُرْمَتُهَا الْيَومَ كَحُرْمَتِهَا بِالْأَمْسِ فَلْيُبَلِّغِ الشَّاهِدُ الْغَائِب»</div><p>(Allah, not the people, made Makkah a sanctuary, so any person who has belief in Allah and the Last Day, should neither shed blood in it nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah's Messenger fought in Makkah, say to him, `Allah allowed His Messenger and did not allow you.' Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the Conquest), and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact).) </p><p>Abu Shurayh was asked, `What did `Amr reply' He said, (`Amr said) `O Abu Shurayh! I know better than you about this, the Sacred House does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.' This Hadith was collected by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p>After this, there is no contradiction between the Hadiths that stated that Allah made Makkah a sanctuary when He created the heavens and earth and the Hadiths that Ibrahim made it a sanctuary, since Ibrahim conveyed Allah's decree that Makkah is a sanctuary, before he built the House. Similarly, the Messenger of Allah was written as the Final Prophet when Adam was still clay. Yet, Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَابْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ</div><p>(Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own) (2: 129). </p><p>Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication, although He had full knowledge beforehand that it will occur by His decree. To further elaborate on this subject, we should mention the Hadith about what the Messenger of Allah said when he was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Tell us about how your prophethood started.\" He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ، وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي كَأَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام»</div><p>(I am the supplication of my father Ibrahim, the good news of Jesus, the son of Mary, and my mother saw a light that radiated from her which illuminated the castles of Ash-Sham (Syria).) </p><p>In this Hadith, the Companions asked the Messenger about the beginning of his prophethood. We will explain this matter later, if Allah wills. </p><h2>Ibrahim invokes Allah to make Makkah an Area of Safety and Sustenance</h2><p>Allah said that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security) (2:126) from terror, so that its people do not suffer from fear. Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</div><p>(Whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:97) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ</div><p>(Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them) (29:67). </p><p>We have already mentioned the Hadiths that prohibit fighting in the Sacred Area. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحِلُّ لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يَحْمِلَ بِمَكَّةَ السِّلَاح»</div><p>(No one is allowed to carry weapons in Makkah.) Allah mentioned that Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security) meaning, make this a safe city. This occurred before the Ka`bah was built. Allah said in Surat Ibrahim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</div><p>(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, \"My Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security...\") (14:35) as here, Ibrahim supplicated a second time after the House was built and its people lived around it, after Ishaq who was thirteen years Isma`il's junior was born. This is why at the end of his supplication, Ibrahim said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ </div><p>(All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Verily, my Lord is indeed the Hearer of invocations) (14:39). </p><p>Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَارْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ الثَّمَرَتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَى عَذَابِ النَّارِ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(\"...and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.\" He (Allah) answered: \"As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!\") </p><p>Ibn Jarir said that Ubayy bin Ka`b commented on, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَى عَذَابِ النَّارِ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(He answered: \"As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!\") \"These are Allah's Words (meaning not Ibrahim's)\" This is also the Tafsir of Mujahid and `Ikrimah. Furthermore, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا وَارْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ الثَّمَرَتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.) \"Ibrahim asked Allah to grant sustenance for the believers only. However, Allah revealed, `I will also provide for the disbelievers, just as I shall provide for the believers.

And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden) (17:20). </p><p>This was recorded by Ibn Marduwyah, who also recorded similar statements from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ </div><p>(Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah will never be successful.

There is an authentic Hadith narrated by `A'ishah on this subject, which we will mention later, Allah willing. </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Prophet Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother and went away with them until he reached the area of the House, where he left them next to a tree above Zamzam in the upper area of the Masjid. During that time, Isma`il's mother was still nursing him. Makkah was then uninhabited, and there was no water source in it. Ibrahim left them there with a bag containing some dates and a water-skin containing water. Ibrahim then started to leave, and Isma`il's mother followed him and said, `O Ibrahim! To whom are you leaving us in this barren valley that is not inhabited' She repeated the question several times and Ibrahim did not reply. She asked, `Has Allah commanded you to do this' He said, `Yes.' She said, `I am satisfied that Allah will never abandon us.' Ibrahim left, and when he was far enough away where they could not see him, close to Thaniyyah, he faced the House, raised his hands and supplicated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّى أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِى بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِى زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ</div><p>(O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah)) until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(Give thanks) (14:37). Isma`il's mother then returned to her place, started drinking water from the water-skin and nursing Isma`il. When the water was used up, she and her son became thirsty. She looked at him, and he was suffering from thirst; she left, because she disliked seeing his face in that condition. She found the nearest mountian to where she was, As-Safa, ascended it and looked, in vain, hoping to see somebody. When she came down to the valley, she raised her garment and ran, just as a tired person runs, until she reached the Al-Marwah mountain. In vain, she looked to see if there was someone there. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) seven times.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"This is why the people make the trip between As-Safa and Al-Marwah (during Hajj and Umrah).\" </p><p>\"When she reached Al-Marwah, she heard a voice and said, `Shush,' to herself. She tried to hear the voice again and when she did, she said, `I have heard you. Do you have relief' She found the angel digging with his heel (or his wing) where Zamzam now exists, and the water gushed out. Isma`il's mother was astonished and started digging, using her hand to transfer water to the water-skin.\" Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet then said, \"May Allah grant His mercy to the mother of Isma`il, had she left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.\" </p><p>\"Isma`il's mother started drinking the water and her milk increased for her child. The angel (Gabriel) said to her, `Do not fear abandonment. There shall be a House for Allah built here by this boy and his father. Allah does not abandon His people.' During that time, the area of the House was raised above ground level and the floods used to reach its right and left sides. </p><p>Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, passing through Kada', made camp at the bottom of the valley. They saw some birds, they were astonished, and said, `Birds can only be found at a place where there is water. We did not notice before that this valley had water.' They sent a scout or two who searched the area, found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to Isma`il's mother, next to the water, and said, `O Mother of Isma`il! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)' She said, `Yes. But you will have no exclusive right to the water here.' They said, `We agree.\"' Ibn `Abbas said that the Prophet said, \"At that time, Isma`il's mother liked to have human company.\" </p><p>\"And thus they stayed there and sent for their relatives to join them. Later on, her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them, for Isma`il learned Arabic from them, and they liked the way he was raised. Isma`il's mother died after that. </p><p>Then an idea occurred to Abraham to visit his dependents. So he left (to Makkah). When he arrived, he did not find Isma`il, so he asked his wife about him. She said, `He has gone out hunting.' When he asked her about their living conditions, she complained to him that they live in misery and poverty. Abraham said (to her), `When your husband comes, convey my greeting and tell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came, he sensed that they had a visitor and asked his wife, `Did we have a visitor' She said, `Yes. An old man came to visit us and asked me about you, and I told him where you were. He also asked about our condition, and I told him that we live in hardship and poverty.' Isma`il said, `Did he ask you to do anything' She said, `Yes. He asked me to convey his greeting and that you should change the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said to her, `He was my father and you are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' So he divorced her and married another woman. Again Ibrahim thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Makkah). Ibrahim came to Isma`il's house, but did not find Isma`il and asked his wife, `Where is Isma`il' Isma`il's wife replied, `He has gone out hunting.' He asked her about their condition, and she said that they have a good life and praised Allah. Ibrahim asked, `What is your food and what is your drink' She replied, `Our food is meat and our drink is water.' He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and their drink.\"' The Prophet (Muhammad ) said, \"They did not have crops then, otherwise Ibrahim would have invoked Allah to bless that too. Those who do not live in Makkah cannot bear eating a diet only containing meat and water.\" </p><p>\"Ibrahim said, `When Isma`il comes back, convey my greeting to him and ask him to keep the threshold of his gate.' When Isma`il came back, he asked, `Has anyone visited us.' She said, `Yes. A good looking old man,' and she praised Ibrahim, `And he asked me about our livelihood and I told him that we live in good conditions.' He asked, `Did he ask you to convey any message' She said, `Yes. He conveyed his greeting to you and said that you should keep the threshold of your gate.' Isma`il said, `That was my father, and you are the threshold; he commanded me to keep you.' </p><p>Ibrahim then came back visiting and found Isma`il behind the Zamzam well, next to a tree, mending his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he stood up and they greeted each other, just as the father and son greet each other. Ibrahim said, `O Isma`il, Your Lord has ordered me to do something.' He said, `Obey your Lord.' He asked Isma`il, `Will you help me' He said, `Yes, I will help you.' Ibrahim said, `Allah has commanded me to build a house for Him there, ' and he pointed to an area that was above ground level. So, both of them rose and started to raise the foundations of the House. Abraham started building (the Ka`bah), while Isma`il continued handing him the stones. Both of them were saying, `O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.' (2.127).\"' Hence, they were building the House, part by part, going around it and saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</div><p>(Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the Hearer, the Knower.) </p><h2>The Story of rebuilding the House by Quraysh before the Messenger of Allah was sent as Prophet</h2><p>In his Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said, \"When the Messenger of Allah reached thirty-five years of age, the Quraysh gathered to rebuild the Ka`bah, this included covering it with a roof. However, they were weary of demolishing it. During that time, the Ka`bah was barely above a man's shoulder, so they wanted to raise its height and build a ceiling on top. Some people had stolen the Ka`bah's treasure beforehand, which used to be in a well in the middle of the Ka`bah. The treasure was later found with a man called, Duwayk, a freed servant of Bani Mulayh bin `Amr, from the tribe of Khuza`ah. The Quraysh cut off his hand as punishment. Some people claimed that those who actually stole the treasure left it with Duwayk. Afterwards, the sea brought a ship that belonged to a Roman merchant to the shores of Jeddah, where it washed-up. So they collected the ship's wood to use it for the Ka`bah's ceiling; a Coptic carpenter in Makkah prepared what they needed for the job. When they decided to begin the demolition process to rebuild the House, Abu Wahb bin `Amr bin `A'idh bin `Abd bin `Imran bin Makhzum took a stone from the Ka`bah; the stone slipped from his hand and went back to where it had been. He said, `O people of Quraysh! Do not spend on rebuilding the House, except from what was earned from pure sources. No money earned from a prostitute, usury or injustice should be included.\"' Ibn Ishaq commented here that the people also attribute these words to Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq continued, \"The Quraysh began to organize their efforts to rebuild the Ka`bah, each subtribe taking the responsibility of rebuilding a designated part of it. </p><p>However, they were still weary about bringing down the Ka`bah. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said, `I will start to bring it down.' He held an ax and stood by the Ka`bah and said, `O Allah! No harm is meant. O Allah! We only seek to do a good service.' He then started to chop the House's stones. The people waited that night and said, `We will wait and see. If something strikes him, we will not bring it down and instead rebuid it the way it was. If nothing happens to him, then Allah will have agreed to what we are doing.' The next morning, Al-Walid went to work on the Ka`bah, and the people started bringing the Ka`bah down with him. When they reached the foundations that Ibrahim built, they uncovered green stones that were above each other, just like a pile of spears.\" Ibn Ishaq then said that some people told him, \"A man from Quraysh, who was helping rebuild the Ka`bah, placed the shovel between two of these stones to pull them up; when one of the stones was moved, all of Makkah shook, so they did not dig up these stones.\" </p><h2>The Dispute regarding Who should place the Black Stone in Its Place</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"The tribes of Quraysh collected stones to rebuild the House, each tribe collecting on their own. They started rebuilding it, until the rebuilding of the Ka`bah reached the point where the Black Stone was to be placed in its designated site. A dispute erupted between the various tribes of Quraysh, each seeking the honor of placing the Black Stone for their own tribe. The dispute almost led to violence between the leaders of Quraysh in the area of the Sacred House. Banu `Abd Ad-Dar and Banu `Adi bin Ka`b bin Lu'ay, gave their mutual pledge to fight until death. However, five or four days later, Abu Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah bin `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Makhzum, the oldest man from Quraysh then intervened at the right moment. Abu Umayyah suggested that Quraysh should appoint the first man to enter the House from its entrance to be a mediator between them. They agreed. </p><p>The Messenger - Muhammad - was the first person to enter the House. When the various leaders of Quraysh realized who the first one was, they all proclaimed, `This is Al-Amin (the Honest one). We all accept him; This is Muhammad.' When the Prophet reached the area where the leaders were gathering and they informed him about their dispute, he asked them to bring a garment and place it on the ground. He placed the Black Stone on it. He then requested that each of the leaders of Quraysh hold the garment from one side and all participate in lifting the Black Stone, moving it to its designated area. Next, the Prophet carried the Black Stone by himself and placed it in its designated position and built around it. The Quraysh used to call the Messenger of Allah `Al-Amin' even before the revelation came to him.\" </p><h2>Ibn Az-Zubayr rebuilds Al-Ka`bah the way the Prophet wished</h2><p>Ibn Ishaq said, \"During the time of the Prophet , the Ka`bah was eighteen cubits high and was covered with Egyptian linen, and they with a striped garment. Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf was the first person to cover it with silk.\" The Ka`bah remained the same way the Quraysh rebuilt it, until it was burned during the reign of `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, after the year 6o H, at the end of the reign of Yazل0d bin Mu`awiyah. During that time, Ibn Az-Zubayr was besieged at Makkah. When it was burned, Ibn Az-Zubayr brought the Ka`bah down and built it upon the foundations of Ibrahim, including the Hijr in it. He also made an eastern door and a western door in the Ka`bah and placed them on ground level. He had heard his aunt `A'ishah, the Mother of the believers, narrate that the Messenger of Allah had wished that. The Ka`bah remained like this throughout his reign, until Al-Hajjaj killed Ibn Az-Zubayr and then rebuilt it the way it was before, by the order of `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. </p><p>Muslim recorded that `Ata' said, \"The House was burnt during the reign of Yazid bin Mu`awiyah, when the people of Ash-Sham raided Makkah. Ibn Az-Zubayr did not touch the House until the people came for Hajj, for he wanted to incite them against the people of Ash-Sham. He said to them, `O people! Advise me regarding the Ka`bah, should we bring it down and rebuild it, or just repair the damage it sustained' Ibn `Abbas said, `I have an opinion about this. You should rebuild the House the way it was when the people became Muslims. You should leave the stones that existed when the people became Muslims and when the Prophet was sent. ' Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `If the house of one of them gets burned, he will not be satisfied, until he rebuilds it. How about Allah's House I will invoke my Lord for three days and will then implement what I decide.' When the three days had passed, he decided to bring the Ka`bah down. The people hesitated to bring it down, fearing that the first person to climb on the House would be struck down. A man went on top of the House and threw some stones down, and when the people saw that no harm touched him, they started doing the same. They brought the House down to ground level. Ibn Az-Zubayr surrounded the site with curtains hanging from pillars, so that the House would be covered, until the building was erect. Ibn Az-Zubayr then said, `I heard `A'ishah say that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْلَا أَنَّ النَّاسَ حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ بِكُفْرٍ، وَلَيْسَ عِنْدِي مِنَ النَّفَقَةِ مَا يُقَوِّينِي عَلى بِنَائِهِ لَكُنْتُ أَدْخَلْتُ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحِجْرِ خَمْسَةَ أَذْرُعٍ، وَلَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ بَابًا يَدْخُلُ النَّاسُ مِنْهُ وَبَابًا يَخْرُجُونَ مِنْه»</div><p>(If it was not for the fact that the people have recently abandoned disbelief, and that I do not have enough money to spend on it, I would have included in the House five cubits from Al-Hijr and would have made a door for it that people could enter from, and another door that they could exit from.) </p><p>Ibn Az-Zubayr said, `I can spend on this job, and I do not fear the people.' So he added five cubits from the Hijr, which looked like a rear part for the House that people could clearly see. He then built the House and made it eighteen cubits high. He thought that the House was still short and added ten cubits in the front and built two doors in it, one as an entrance and another as an exit. </p><p>When Ibn Az-Zubayr was killed, Al-Hajjaj wrote to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan asking him about the House and told him that Ibn Az-Zubayr made a rear section for the House. `Abdul-Malik wrote back, `We do not agree with Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions. As, for the Ka`bah's height, leave it as it is. As for what he added from the Hijr, bring it down, and build the House as it was before and close the door.' Therefore, Al-Hajjaj brought down the House and rebuilt it as it was.\" In his Sunan, An-Nasa'i collected the Hadith of the Prophet narrated from `A'ishah, not the whole story, </p><p>The correct Sunnah conformed to Ibn Az-Zubayr's actions, because this was what the Prophet wished he could do, but feared that the hearts of the people who recently became Muslim could not bear rebuilding the House. This Sunnah was not clear to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan. Hence, when `Abdul-Malik realized that `A'ishah had narrated the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah on this subject, he said, \"I wish we had left it as Ibn Az-Zubayr had made it.\" Muslim recorded that `Ubadydullah bin `Ubayd said that Al-Harith bin `Abdullah came to `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan during his reign. `Abdul-Malik said, `I did not think that Abu Khubayb (Ibn Az-Zubayr) heard from `A'ishah what he said he heard from her.' Al-Harith said, `Yes he did. I heard the Hadith from her.' `Abdul-Malik said, `You heard her say what' He said, `She said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ قَوْمَكِ اسْتَقْصَرُوا مِنْ بُنْيَانِ الْبَيْتِ وَلَوْلَا حَدَاثَةُ عَهْدِهِمْ بِالشِّرْكِ أَعَدْتُ مَا تَرَكُوا مِنْهُ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لِقَوْمِكِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَنْ يَبْنُوهُ فَهَلُمِّي لِأُرِيَكِ مَا تَرَكُوهُ مِنْه»</div><p>(Your people rebuilt the House smaller.

This accepted supplication, from Ibrahim, conformed with Allah's appointed destiny that Muhammad be sent as a Messenger among the Ummiyyin and to all non-Arabs, among the Jinns and mankind. </p><p>Hence, Ibrahim was the first person to mention the Prophet to the people. Ever since, Muhammad was known to the people, until the last Prophet was sent among the Children of Israel, Jesus the son of Mary, who mentioned Muhammad by name. Jesus addressed the Children of Israel saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّراً بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</div><p>(I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming what is before me in the Tawrah, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad) (61:6) </p><p>This is why the Prophet said , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعْوَةُ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَبُشْرَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَم»</div><p>(The supplication of my father Ibrahim and the glad tidings brought forth by Jesus the son of Mary.) </p><p>The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَرَأَتْ أُمِّي أَنَّهُ خَرَجَ مِنْهَا نُورٌ أَضَاءَتْ لَهُ قُصُورُ الشَّام»</div><p>(My mother saw a light that went out of her and radiated the palaces of Ash-Sham.) </p><p>It was said that the Prophet's mother saw this vision when she was pregnant with, narrated this vision to her people, and the story became popular among them. The light mentioned in the Hadith appeared in Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), testifying to what will later occur when the Prophet's religion will be firmly established in Ash-Sham area. This is why by the end of time, Ash-Sham will be a refuge for Islam and its people. Also, Jesus the son of Mary will descend in Ash-Sham, next to the eastern white minaret in Damascus. The Two Sahihs stated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ كَذَلِك»</div><p>وفي صحيح البخاري </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَهُمْ بالشَّام»</div><p>(There will always be a group of my Ummah who will be on the truth, undeterred by those who fail or oppose them, until the command of Allah comes while they are on this.) </p><p>Al-Bukhari added in his Sahih, (And they will reside in Ash-Sham.) </p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Kitab wal-Hikmah</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ</div><p>(and instruct them in the Book) meaning, Al-Qur'an, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْحِكْــمَةِ</div><p>(and Al-Hikmah) meaning, the Sunnah, as Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Abu Malik asserted. It was also said that `Al-Hikmah', means `comprehension in the religion', and both meanings are correct. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said, that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ</div><p>(and purify them) means, \"With the obedience of Allah.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكَ أَنتَ العَزِيزُ الحَكِيمُ</div><p>(Verily, You are the Mighty, the Wise). </p><p>This Ayah stated that Allah is able to do anything, and nothing escapes His ability.

Also, Jacob built Bayt Al-Maqdis, as earlier books testified. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Which Masjid was built first' He said, (Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Al-Ka`bah).) I said, `Then' He said, (Bayt Al- Maqdis.) I said, `How many years later' He said, (Forty years. )\" Further, the advice that Jacob gave to his children, which we will soon mention, testifies that Jacob was among those who received the advice mentioned in Ayat above (2:130-132). </p><h2>Adhering to Tawhid until Death</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـبَنِىَّ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَى لَكُمُ الدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إَلاَّ وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ</div><p>((Saying), \"O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except as Muslims.\") meaning, perform righteous deeds during your lifetime and remain on this path, so that Allah will endow you with the favor of dying upon it. Usually, one dies upon the path that he lived on and is resurrected according to what he died on. Allah, the Most Generous, helps those who seek to do good deeds to remain on the righteous path. </p><p>This by no means contradicts the authentic Hadith that says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَعْمَلُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ حَتّـى مَا يَكُونُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَهَا إِلَّا بَاعٌ أَوْ ذِرَاعٌ فَيَسْبِقُ عَلَيْهِ الْكِتَابُ فَيَعمَلُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ النَّار فَيَدْخُلُهَا. وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَعْمَلُ بعَمَلِ أَهلِ النَّارِ حَتَّى مَا يَكُونُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَهَا إِلَّا بَاعٌ أَو ذِرَاعٌ فَيَسْبِقُ عَلَيْهِ الْكِتَابُ فَيَعْمَلُ بعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ فَيَدْخُلُهَا»</div><p>(Man might perform the works of the people of Paradise until only a span of outstretched arms or a cubit separates him from it, then the Book (destiny) takes precedence, and he performs the works of the people of the Fire and thus enters it.

It was reported that this was also the opinion of `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali, bin Mas`ud, Zayd bin Thabit and several scholars among the Salaf and later generations. </p><p>The statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا</div><p>(One Ilah (God)) means, \"We single Him out in divinity and do not associate anything or anyone with Him.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</div><p>(And to Him we submit), in obedience meaning, obedient and submissiveness. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(While to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned) (3:83). </p><p>Indeed, Islam is the religion of all the Prophets, even if their reispective laws differed. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ </div><p>(And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad ) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (alone and none else)) (21:25). </p><p>There are many other Ayat - and Hadiths - on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ دِينُنا وَاحِد»</div><p>(We, the Prophets, are brothers with different mothers, but the same religion.) </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ</div><p>(That was a nation who has passed away) meaning, existed before your time, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم</div><p>(They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn). </p><p>This Ayah proclaims, Your relationship to the Prophets or righteous people among your ancestors will not benefit you, unless you perform good deeds that bring about you religious benefit. They have their deeds and you have yours, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُسْـَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And you will not be asked of what they used to do).\" </p><p>This is why a Hadith proclaims, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَطَّأَ بِهِ عَمَلُهُ لَمْ يُسْرِعْ بِهِ نَسَبُه»</div><p>(Whoever was slowed on account of his deeds will not get any faster on account of his family lineage.)' </p>"

Similarly, Allah said in the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ إِبْرَهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </div><p>(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa (to worship none but Allah alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikin) (3:67) and the following Ayat. Allah also said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَتَمَ شَهَـدَةً عِندَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ</div><p>And who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony he has from Allah؟ )2:140(. Al-Hلasan Al-Basلri said, They used to recite the Book of Allah He sent to them that stated that the true religion is Isla0m and that Muhلammad is the Messenger of Allah. Their Book also stated that Ibra0h0m, Isma0 0l, Ishلa0q, Ya qu0b and the tribes were neither Jews, nor Christians. They testified to these facts, yet hid them from the people. Allah s statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَـفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And Allah is not unaware of what you do), is a threat and a warning that His knowledge encompasses every one's deeds, and He shall award each accordingly. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ</div><p>(That was a nation who has passed away.) meaning, existed before you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم</div><p>(They shall receive the reward of what they earned, and you of what you earn.) meaning, they bear their deeds while you bear yours, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُسْـَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And you will not be asked of what they used to do) meaning, the fact that you are their relatives will not suffice, unless you imitate their good deeds. Further, do not be deceived by the fact that you are their descendants, unless you imitate them in obeying Allah's orders and following His Messengers who were sent as warners and bearers of good news. Indeed, whoever disbelieves in even one Prophet, will have disbelieved in all the Messengers, especially if one disbelieves in the master and Final Messenger from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, to all mankind and the Jinns. May Allah's peace and blessings be on Muhammad and the rest of Allah's Prophets. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Changing the Qiblah @ Direction of the Prayer</h2><p>Imam Al-Bukhari reported that Al-Bara' bin `Azib narrated: \"Allah's Messenger offered his prayers facing Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka`bah (at Makkah). The first prayer which he offered (facing the Ka`bah) was the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him, went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were in the bowing position (in Ruku`) during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He addressed them saying, `By Allah, I bear witness that I have offered prayer with the Prophet facing Makkah (Ka`bah).' Hearing that, those people immediately changed their direction towards the House (Ka`bah) while still as they were (i.e., in the same bowing position). Some Muslims who offered prayer towards the previous Qiblah (Jerusalem) before it was changed towards the House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) had died or had been martyred, and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers towards Jerusalem). Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., the prayers of those Muslims were valid)) (2:143).\" </p><p>Al-Bukhari collected this narration, while Muslim collected it using another chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Al-Bara' narrated: Allah's Messenger used to offer prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem), but would keep looking at the sky awaiting Allah's command (to change the Qiblah). Then Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad's) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) (2:144) </p><p>A man from among the Muslims then said, \"We wish we could know about those among us who died before the Qiblah was changed (i.e., towards Makkah) and also about our own prayers, that we had performed towards Bayt Al-Maqdis.\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) (2:143) </p><p>The fools among the people, meaning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), said, \"What made them change the former Qiblah that they used to face\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَقُولُ السُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(The fools (idolators, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say...) </p><p>until the end of the Ayah. </p><p>`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said: When Allah's Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Jews were delighted then. Allah's Messenger faced Jerusalem for over ten months. However, he liked (to offer prayer in the direction of) Prophet Ibrahim's Qiblah (the Ka`bah in Makkah) and used to supplicate to Allah and kept looking up to the sky (awaiting Allah's command in this regard). Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ</div><p>(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) meaning, its direction. The Jews did not like this change and said, \"What made them change the Qiblah that they used to face (meaning Jerusalem)\" Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.\") </p><p>There are several other Ahadith on this subject. In summary, Allah's Messenger was commanded to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (during the prayer) and he used to offer prayer towards it in Makkah between the two corners (of Ka`bah), so that the Ka`bah would be between him and Bayt Al-Maqdis8. When the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, this practice was no longer possible; then Allah commanded him to offer prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, as Ibn Abbas and the majority of the scholars have stated. </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the news (of the change of Qiblah) was conveyed to some of the Ansar while they were performing the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, upon hearing that, they immediately changed their direction and faced the Ka`bah. </p><p>It is reported in the Sahihayn (Al-Bukhari Muslim) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were in Quba' (Mosque) performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, a man came and said, \"A (part of the) Qur'an was revealed tonight to Allah's Messenger and he was commanded to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah. They were facing Ash-Sham, so they turned towards the Ka`bah. </p><p>These Hadiths prove that the Nasikh (a Text that abrogates a previous Text) only applies after one acquires knowledge of it, even if the Nasikh had already been revealed and announced. This is why the Companions mentioned above were not commanded to repeat the previous `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha' prayers (although they had prayed them towards Jerusalem after Allah had changed the Qiblah). Allah knows best. </p><p>When the change of Qiblah (to Ka`bah in Makkah) occurred, those inflicted with hypocrisy and mistrust, and the disbelieving Jews, both were led astray from the right guidance and fell into confusion. They said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا وَلَّـهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ الَّتِى كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا</div><p>(What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah to which they used to face in prayer.) </p><p>They asked, \"What is the matter with these people (Muslims) who one time face this direction (Jerusalem), and then face that direction (Makkah)\" Allah answered their questions when He stated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west.) meaning, the command, the decision and the authority are for Allah Alone. Hence: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(...so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne).) (2:115), </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>( It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is the one who believes in Allah.) (2:177) This statement means, the best act is to adhere to Allah's commands. Hence, wherever He commands us to face, we should face. Also, since obedience requires implementing Allah's commands, if He commands us every day to face different places, we are His servants and under His disposal, and we face whatever He orders us to face. Certainly, Allah's care and kindness towards His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , and certainly, his Ummah (Muslim nation) is profoundly great. Allah has guided them to the Qiblah of (Prophet) Ibrahim -- Allah's Khalil (intimate friend). He has commanded them to face the Ka`bah, the most honorable house (of worship) on the face of the earth, which was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil in the Name of Allah, the One without a partner. This is why Allah said afterwards: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.\") </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that `A'ishah (the Prophet's wife) said that Allah's Messenger said about the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّهُم لا يَحْسِدونَنَا عَلَى شَيْء كَمَا يَحْسِدونَنا عَلَى يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى الْقِبْلَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى قَوْلِنَا خَلْفَ الإِمَامِ: آمِين»</div><p>(They do not envy us for a matter more than they envy us for Jumu`ah (Friday) to which Allah has guided us and from which they were led astray; for the (true) Qiblah to which Allah has directed us and from which they were led astray; and for our saying `Amin' behind the Imam (leader of the prayer).) </p><h2>The Virtues of Muhammad's Nation</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you true Muslims, a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad ) be a witness over you.) </p><p>Allah stated that He has changed our Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim and chose it for us so that He makes us the best nation ever. Hence, we will be the witnesses over the nations on the Day of Resurrection, for all of them will then agree concerning our virtue. The word Wasat in the Ayah means the best and the most honored. Therefore, saying that (the Prophet's tribe) Quraysh is in the Wasat regarding Arab tribes and their areas, means the best. Similarly, saying that Allah's Messenger was in the Wasat of his people, means he was from the best subtribe. Also, `Asr, the prayer that is described as `Wusta' (a variation of the word Wasat), means the best prayer, as the authentic collections of Ahadith reported. Since Allah made this Ummah (Muslim nation) the Wasat, He has endowed her with the most complete legislation, the best Manhaj (way, method, etc.,) and the clearest Madhhab (methodology, mannerism, etc). Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind), and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship: it is the religion of your father Ibrahim. It is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Qur'an), that the Messenger (Muhammad ) may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) (22:78) </p><p>Moreover, Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Sa`id narrated: Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُدْعَى نُوحٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامة، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: نَعَمْ، فَيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ: هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ فَيَقُولُونَ: مَا أتَانَا مِنْ نَذِيرٍ وَمَا أتَانَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ، فَيُقَالُ لِنُوح: مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، قال فَذلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ: والْوَسَطُ الْعَدْلُ، فَتُدْعَون فَتَشْهَدُونَ لَهُ بِالْبَلَاغِ ثُمَّ أَشْهَدُ عَلَيْكُم»</div><p>(Nuh will be called on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message)' He will say, `Yes.' His people will be summoned and asked, `Has Nuh conveyed (the Message) to you' They will say, `No warner came to us and no one (Prophet) was sent to us.' Nuh will be asked, `Who testifies for you' He will say, `Muhammad and his Ummah.') </p><p>This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you a Wasat nation.) </p><p>The Prophet said; (The Wasat means the `Adl (just). You will be summoned to testify that Nuh has conveyed (his Message), and I will attest to your testimony.) </p><p>It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. </p><p>Imam Ahmad also reported that Abu Sa`id Khudri narrated: Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجِيءُ النَّبِيُّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَمَعَهُ الرَّجُلَانِ وَأَكْثَرُ مِنْ ذلِكَ، فيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ، فَيُقَالُ: هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ هَذَا؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: لَا فَيُقالُ لَهُ: هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ قَوْمَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: نَعَمْ، فَيُقالُ: مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، فَيُدْعَى مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ: هَلْ بَلَّغَ هذَا قَوْمَهُ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: نَعَمْ، فَيُقَالُ: وَمَا عِلْمُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: جَاءَنَا نَبِيُّنَاصلى الله عليه وسلّم فأخْبَرَنَا أَنَّ الرُّسُلَ قَدْ بَلَّغُوا، فَذلِك قَوْلُهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>قَالَ: عَدْلًا </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(The Prophet would come on the Day of Resurrection with two or more people (his only following!), and his people would also be summoned and asked, `Has he (their Prophet) conveyed (the Message) to you' They would say, `No.' He would be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message) to your people' He would say, `Yes.' He would be asked, `Who testifies for you' He would say, `Muhammad and his Ummah.' Muhammad and his Ummah would then be summoned and asked, `Has he conveyed (the Message) to his people' They would say, `Yes.' They would be asked, `Who told you that' They would say, `Our Prophet (Muhammad) came to us and told us that the Messengers have conveyed (their Messages). ') </p><p>Hence Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you a Wasat nation.) </p><p>He said, \"(meaning) the `Adl,' (he then continued reciting the Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you, a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad ) be a witness over you.)\" </p><p>Furthermore, Imam Ahmad reported that Abul-Aswad narrated: I came to Al-Madinah and found that an epidemic had broken out that caused many fatalities. I sat next to `Umar bin Al-Khattab once when a funeral procession started and the people praised the dead person. `Umar said, \"Wajabat (it will be recorded as such), Wajabat!\" Then another funeral was brought forth and the people criticized the dead person. Again, `Umar said, \"Wajabat.\" Abul-Aswad asked, \"What is Wajabat, O Leader of the faithful\" He said, \"I said just like Allah's Messenger had said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُّمَا مُسْلِمٍ شَهِدَ لَهُ أَرْبَعَةٌ بِخَيْر أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّــة»</div><p>قَالَ: فَقُلْنَا وَثَلَاثَةٌ؟ قَالَ: فَقَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَثَلَاثَــــة»</div><p>قَالَ: فَقُلْنَا وَاثْنَانِ: قَالَ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَاثْنَان»</div><p>. ثُمَّ لَمْ نَسْأَلْهُ عَنِ الْوَاحِدِ. </p><p>(Any Muslim for whom four testify that he was righteous, then Allah will enter him into Paradise.' We said, `What about three' He said, `And three.' We said, `And two' He said, `And two.' We did not ask him about (the testimony) of one (believing) person.)\" </p><p>This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. </p><h2>The Wisdom behind changing the Qiblah</h2><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِى كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult) except for those whom Allah guided.) </p><p>Allah states thus: We have legislated for you, O Muhammad, facing Bayt Al-Maqdis at first and then changed it to the Ka`bah so as to find who will follow and obey you and thus face whatever you face. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ</div><p>(...from those who would turn on their heels.) meaning, reverts from his religion. Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً</div><p>(Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult)) </p><p>The Ayah indicates that changing the Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis to the Ka`bah is heavy on the heart, except for whomever Allah has rightly guided their hearts, who believe in the truth of the Messenger with certainty and that whatever he was sent with is the truth without doubt. It is they who believe that Allah does what He wills, decides what He wills, commands His servants with what He wills, abrogates any of His commands that He wills, and that He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all this. (The attitude of the believers in this respect is) unlike those who have a disease in their hearts, to whom whenever a matter occurs, it causes doubts, just as this same matter adds faith and certainty to the believers. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</div><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah (chapter from the Qur'an), some of them (hypocrites) say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add doubt and disbelief to their doubt and disbelief; and they die while they are disbelievers.) (9:124, 125) </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا </div><p>(And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss.) (17:82) </p><p>Certainly, those who remained faithful to the Messenger , obeyed him and faced whatever Allah commanded them, without doubt or hesitation, were the leaders of the Companions. Some scholars stated that the Early Migrants (who migrated with the Prophet from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and Ansar (the residents of Al-Madinah who gave aid and refuge to both the Prophet and the Migrants) were those who offered prayers towards the two Qiblah (Bayt Al-Maqdis and then the Ka`bah). Al-Bukhari reported in the explanation of the Ayah (2:143) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer in the Quba' Mosque, a man came and said, \"Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet and he was ordered to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah.\" They then faced the Ka`bah. Muslim also recorded it. </p><p>At-Tirmidhi added that they were performing Ruku` (bowing down in prayer), and then changed the direction (of the Qiblah) to the Ka`bah while still bowing down. Muslim reported this last narration from Anas. These Hadiths all indicate the perfect obedience the Companions had for Allah and His Messenger and their compliance with Allah's commandments, may Allah be pleased with them all. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) meaning, the reward of your prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis before would not be lost with Allah. It is reported in Sahih that Abu Ishaq As-Sabi`y related that Bara' narrated: \"The people asked about the matter of those who offered prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis and died (before the Qiblah was changed to Ka`bah). Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.)\" </p><p>It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi from Ibn `Abbas, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas narrated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith to be lost.) entails: Your (prayer towards) the first Qiblah and your believing your Prophet and obeying him by facing the second Qiblah; He will grant you the rewards for all these acts. Indeed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.)\" </p><p>Furthermore, it is reported in the Sahih that Allah's Messenger saw a woman among the captives who was separated from her child.

      "text": "<h2>Changing the Qiblah @ Direction of the Prayer</h2><p>Imam Al-Bukhari reported that Al-Bara' bin `Azib narrated: \"Allah's Messenger offered his prayers facing Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka`bah (at Makkah). The first prayer which he offered (facing the Ka`bah) was the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him, went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were in the bowing position (in Ruku`) during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He addressed them saying, `By Allah, I bear witness that I have offered prayer with the Prophet facing Makkah (Ka`bah).' Hearing that, those people immediately changed their direction towards the House (Ka`bah) while still as they were (i.e., in the same bowing position). Some Muslims who offered prayer towards the previous Qiblah (Jerusalem) before it was changed towards the House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) had died or had been martyred, and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers towards Jerusalem). Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., the prayers of those Muslims were valid)) (2:143).\" </p><p>Al-Bukhari collected this narration, while Muslim collected it using another chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Al-Bara' narrated: Allah's Messenger used to offer prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem), but would keep looking at the sky awaiting Allah's command (to change the Qiblah). Then Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad's) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) (2:144) </p><p>A man from among the Muslims then said, \"We wish we could know about those among us who died before the Qiblah was changed (i.e., towards Makkah) and also about our own prayers, that we had performed towards Bayt Al-Maqdis.\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) (2:143) </p><p>The fools among the people, meaning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), said, \"What made them change the former Qiblah that they used to face\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَقُولُ السُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(The fools (idolators, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say...) </p><p>until the end of the Ayah. </p><p>`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said: When Allah's Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Jews were delighted then. Allah's Messenger faced Jerusalem for over ten months. However, he liked (to offer prayer in the direction of) Prophet Ibrahim's Qiblah (the Ka`bah in Makkah) and used to supplicate to Allah and kept looking up to the sky (awaiting Allah's command in this regard). Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ</div><p>(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) meaning, its direction. The Jews did not like this change and said, \"What made them change the Qiblah that they used to face (meaning Jerusalem)\" Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.\") </p><p>There are several other Ahadith on this subject. In summary, Allah's Messenger was commanded to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (during the prayer) and he used to offer prayer towards it in Makkah between the two corners (of Ka`bah), so that the Ka`bah would be between him and Bayt Al-Maqdis8. When the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, this practice was no longer possible; then Allah commanded him to offer prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, as Ibn Abbas and the majority of the scholars have stated. </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the news (of the change of Qiblah) was conveyed to some of the Ansar while they were performing the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, upon hearing that, they immediately changed their direction and faced the Ka`bah. </p><p>It is reported in the Sahihayn (Al-Bukhari Muslim) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were in Quba' (Mosque) performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, a man came and said, \"A (part of the) Qur'an was revealed tonight to Allah's Messenger and he was commanded to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah. They were facing Ash-Sham, so they turned towards the Ka`bah. </p><p>These Hadiths prove that the Nasikh (a Text that abrogates a previous Text) only applies after one acquires knowledge of it, even if the Nasikh had already been revealed and announced. This is why the Companions mentioned above were not commanded to repeat the previous `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha' prayers (although they had prayed them towards Jerusalem after Allah had changed the Qiblah). Allah knows best. </p><p>When the change of Qiblah (to Ka`bah in Makkah) occurred, those inflicted with hypocrisy and mistrust, and the disbelieving Jews, both were led astray from the right guidance and fell into confusion. They said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا وَلَّـهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ الَّتِى كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا</div><p>(What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah to which they used to face in prayer.) </p><p>They asked, \"What is the matter with these people (Muslims) who one time face this direction (Jerusalem), and then face that direction (Makkah)\" Allah answered their questions when He stated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west.) meaning, the command, the decision and the authority are for Allah Alone. Hence: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(...so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne).) (2:115), </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>( It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is the one who believes in Allah.) (2:177) This statement means, the best act is to adhere to Allah's commands. Hence, wherever He commands us to face, we should face. Also, since obedience requires implementing Allah's commands, if He commands us every day to face different places, we are His servants and under His disposal, and we face whatever He orders us to face. Certainly, Allah's care and kindness towards His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , and certainly, his Ummah (Muslim nation) is profoundly great. Allah has guided them to the Qiblah of (Prophet) Ibrahim -- Allah's Khalil (intimate friend). He has commanded them to face the Ka`bah, the most honorable house (of worship) on the face of the earth, which was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil in the Name of Allah, the One without a partner. This is why Allah said afterwards: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.\") </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that `A'ishah (the Prophet's wife) said that Allah's Messenger said about the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّهُم لا يَحْسِدونَنَا عَلَى شَيْء كَمَا يَحْسِدونَنا عَلَى يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى الْقِبْلَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى قَوْلِنَا خَلْفَ الإِمَامِ: آمِين»</div><p>(They do not envy us for a matter more than they envy us for Jumu`ah (Friday) to which Allah has guided us and from which they were led astray; for the (true) Qiblah to which Allah has directed us and from which they were led astray; and for our saying `Amin' behind the Imam (leader of the prayer).) </p><h2>The Virtues of Muhammad's Nation</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you true Muslims, a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad ) be a witness over you.) </p><p>Allah stated that He has changed our Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim and chose it for us so that He makes us the best nation ever. Hence, we will be the witnesses over the nations on the Day of Resurrection, for all of them will then agree concerning our virtue. The word Wasat in the Ayah means the best and the most honored. Therefore, saying that (the Prophet's tribe) Quraysh is in the Wasat regarding Arab tribes and their areas, means the best. Similarly, saying that Allah's Messenger was in the Wasat of his people, means he was from the best subtribe. Also, `Asr, the prayer that is described as `Wusta' (a variation of the word Wasat), means the best prayer, as the authentic collections of Ahadith reported. Since Allah made this Ummah (Muslim nation) the Wasat, He has endowed her with the most complete legislation, the best Manhaj (way, method, etc.,) and the clearest Madhhab (methodology, mannerism, etc). Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind), and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship: it is the religion of your father Ibrahim. It is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Qur'an), that the Messenger (Muhammad ) may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) (22:78) </p><p>Moreover, Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Sa`id narrated: Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُدْعَى نُوحٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامة، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: نَعَمْ، فَيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ: هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ فَيَقُولُونَ: مَا أتَانَا مِنْ نَذِيرٍ وَمَا أتَانَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ، فَيُقَالُ لِنُوح: مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، قال فَذلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ: والْوَسَطُ الْعَدْلُ، فَتُدْعَون فَتَشْهَدُونَ لَهُ بِالْبَلَاغِ ثُمَّ أَشْهَدُ عَلَيْكُم»</div><p>(Nuh will be called on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message)' He will say, `Yes.' His people will be summoned and asked, `Has Nuh conveyed (the Message) to you' They will say, `No warner came to us and no one (Prophet) was sent to us.' Nuh will be asked, `Who testifies for you' He will say, `Muhammad and his Ummah.') </p><p>This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you a Wasat nation.) </p><p>The Prophet said; (The Wasat means the `Adl (just). You will be summoned to testify that Nuh has conveyed (his Message), and I will attest to your testimony.) </p><p>It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. </p><p>Imam Ahmad also reported that Abu Sa`id Khudri narrated: Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَجِيءُ النَّبِيُّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَمَعَهُ الرَّجُلَانِ وَأَكْثَرُ مِنْ ذلِكَ، فيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ، فَيُقَالُ: هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ هَذَا؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: لَا فَيُقالُ لَهُ: هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ قَوْمَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: نَعَمْ، فَيُقالُ: مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، فَيُدْعَى مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ، فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ: هَلْ بَلَّغَ هذَا قَوْمَهُ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: نَعَمْ، فَيُقَالُ: وَمَا عِلْمُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: جَاءَنَا نَبِيُّنَاصلى الله عليه وسلّم فأخْبَرَنَا أَنَّ الرُّسُلَ قَدْ بَلَّغُوا، فَذلِك قَوْلُهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>قَالَ: عَدْلًا </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(The Prophet would come on the Day of Resurrection with two or more people (his only following!), and his people would also be summoned and asked, `Has he (their Prophet) conveyed (the Message) to you' They would say, `No.' He would be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message) to your people' He would say, `Yes.' He would be asked, `Who testifies for you' He would say, `Muhammad and his Ummah.' Muhammad and his Ummah would then be summoned and asked, `Has he conveyed (the Message) to his people' They would say, `Yes.' They would be asked, `Who told you that' They would say, `Our Prophet (Muhammad) came to us and told us that the Messengers have conveyed (their Messages). ') </p><p>Hence Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you a Wasat nation.) </p><p>He said, \"(meaning) the `Adl,' (he then continued reciting the Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَـكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</div><p>(Thus We have made you, a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad ) be a witness over you.)\" </p><p>Furthermore, Imam Ahmad reported that Abul-Aswad narrated: I came to Al-Madinah and found that an epidemic had broken out that caused many fatalities. I sat next to `Umar bin Al-Khattab once when a funeral procession started and the people praised the dead person. `Umar said, \"Wajabat (it will be recorded as such), Wajabat!\" Then another funeral was brought forth and the people criticized the dead person. Again, `Umar said, \"Wajabat.\" Abul-Aswad asked, \"What is Wajabat, O Leader of the faithful\" He said, \"I said just like Allah's Messenger had said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُّمَا مُسْلِمٍ شَهِدَ لَهُ أَرْبَعَةٌ بِخَيْر أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّــة»</div><p>قَالَ: فَقُلْنَا وَثَلَاثَةٌ؟ قَالَ: فَقَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَثَلَاثَــــة»</div><p>قَالَ: فَقُلْنَا وَاثْنَانِ: قَالَ </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَاثْنَان»</div><p>. ثُمَّ لَمْ نَسْأَلْهُ عَنِ الْوَاحِدِ. </p><p>(Any Muslim for whom four testify that he was righteous, then Allah will enter him into Paradise.' We said, `What about three' He said, `And three.' We said, `And two' He said, `And two.' We did not ask him about (the testimony) of one (believing) person.)\" </p><p>This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. </p><h2>The Wisdom behind changing the Qiblah</h2><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِى كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult) except for those whom Allah guided.) </p><p>Allah states thus: We have legislated for you, O Muhammad, facing Bayt Al-Maqdis at first and then changed it to the Ka`bah so as to find who will follow and obey you and thus face whatever you face. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ</div><p>(...from those who would turn on their heels.) meaning, reverts from his religion. Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً</div><p>(Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult)) </p><p>The Ayah indicates that changing the Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis to the Ka`bah is heavy on the heart, except for whomever Allah has rightly guided their hearts, who believe in the truth of the Messenger with certainty and that whatever he was sent with is the truth without doubt. It is they who believe that Allah does what He wills, decides what He wills, commands His servants with what He wills, abrogates any of His commands that He wills, and that He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all this. (The attitude of the believers in this respect is) unlike those who have a disease in their hearts, to whom whenever a matter occurs, it causes doubts, just as this same matter adds faith and certainty to the believers. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</div><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah (chapter from the Qur'an), some of them (hypocrites) say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add doubt and disbelief to their doubt and disbelief; and they die while they are disbelievers.) (9:124, 125) </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا </div><p>(And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss.) (17:82) </p><p>Certainly, those who remained faithful to the Messenger , obeyed him and faced whatever Allah commanded them, without doubt or hesitation, were the leaders of the Companions. Some scholars stated that the Early Migrants (who migrated with the Prophet from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and Ansar (the residents of Al-Madinah who gave aid and refuge to both the Prophet and the Migrants) were those who offered prayers towards the two Qiblah (Bayt Al-Maqdis and then the Ka`bah). Al-Bukhari reported in the explanation of the Ayah (2:143) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer in the Quba' Mosque, a man came and said, \"Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet and he was ordered to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah.\" They then faced the Ka`bah. Muslim also recorded it. </p><p>At-Tirmidhi added that they were performing Ruku` (bowing down in prayer), and then changed the direction (of the Qiblah) to the Ka`bah while still bowing down. Muslim reported this last narration from Anas. These Hadiths all indicate the perfect obedience the Companions had for Allah and His Messenger and their compliance with Allah's commandments, may Allah be pleased with them all. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) meaning, the reward of your prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis before would not be lost with Allah. It is reported in Sahih that Abu Ishaq As-Sabi`y related that Bara' narrated: \"The people asked about the matter of those who offered prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis and died (before the Qiblah was changed to Ka`bah). Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.)\" </p><p>It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi from Ibn `Abbas, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas narrated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَـنَكُمْ</div><p>(And Allah would never make your faith to be lost.) entails: Your (prayer towards) the first Qiblah and your believing your Prophet and obeying him by facing the second Qiblah; He will grant you the rewards for all these acts. Indeed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.)\" </p><p>Furthermore, it is reported in the Sahih that Allah's Messenger saw a woman among the captives who was separated from her child. Whenever she found a boy (infant) among the captives, she would hold him close to her chest, as she was looking for her boy. When she found her child, she embraced him and gave him her breast to nurse. Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">« أَتُرَوْنَ هذِهِ طَارِحَةً وَلَدَهَا فِي النَّارِ وَهِي تَقْدِرُ عَلى أَنْ لَا تَطْرَحَه»</div><p>؟ قَالُوا: لَا يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ. قَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَوَاللهِ للهُ أَرْحَمُ بِعِبَادِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ بِوَلَدِهَا»</div><p>(Do you think that this woman would willingly throw her son in the fire) They said, \"No, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said, (By Allah! Allah is more merciful with His servants than this woman with her son.) </p>"

Allah's Messenger faced it for ten and some months, but he liked to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim (Ka`bah in Makkah). He used to supplicate to Allah and look up to the sky (awaiting Allah's command). Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad's) face towards the heaven), until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ</div><p>(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) </p><p>The Jews did not like this ruling and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا وَلَّـهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ الَّتِى كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا قُل لّلَّهِ الْمَشْرِقُ وَالْمَغْرِبُ</div><p>(\"What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah (prayer direction) to which they used to face in prayer.\" Say (O Muhammad), \"To Allah belong both, east and the west.\") (2:142) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(. ..so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah) (2:115), </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِى كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ</div><p>(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger).) (2:143) </p><h2>Is the Qiblah the Ka`bah itself or its General Direction</h2><p>Al-Hakim related that `Ali bin Abu Talib said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(...so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) means its direction.\" </p><p>Al-Hakim then commented that the chain of this narration is authentic and that they (i.e., Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not include it in their collections. </p><p>This ruling concerning the Qiblah is also the opinion of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others. Allah's Statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ</div><p>(And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction) is a command from Allah to face the Ka`bah from wherever one is on the earth: the east, west, north or south. The exception is of the voluntary prayer (Nafl) while one is traveling, for one is allowed to offer it in any direction his body is facing, while his heart is intending the Ka`bah. Also, when the battle is raging, one is allowed to offer prayer, however he is able. Also, included are those who are not sure of the direction and offer prayer in the wrong direction, thinking that it is the direction of the Qiblah, because Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. </p><h2>The Jews had Knowledge that the (Muslim) Qiblah would later be changed</h2><p>Allah stated that: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ</div><p>(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord.) </p><p>This Ayah means: The Jews, who did not like that you change your Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis, already knew that Allah will command you (O Muhammad) to face the Ka`bah. The Jews read in their Books their Prophets' description of Allah's Messenger and his Ummah, and that Allah has endowed and honored him with the complete and honorable legislation. Yet, the People of the Book deny these facts because of their envy, disbelief and rebellion. This is why Allah threatened them when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَـفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And Allah is not unaware of what they do.) </p>"

In another instance, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ </div><p>(Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.

Allah's statement also indicates that as much as the Jews adhere to their opinions and desires, the Prophet adheres by Allah's commands, obeying Him and following what pleases Him, and that he would never adhere to their desires in any case. Hence, praying towards Bayt Al-Maqdis was not because it was the Qiblah of the Jews, but because Allah had commanded it. Allah then warns those who knowingly defy the truth, because the proof against those who know is stronger than against other people. This is why Allah said to His Messenger and his Ummah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذَا لَّمِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers.) </p>"

The Messenger also takes them away from the darkness (of disbelief) to the light (of faith) and teaches them the Book, the Qur'an, and the Hikmah (i.e., the wisdom), which is his Sunnah. He also teaches them what they knew not. During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to utter foolish statements. Later on, and with the blessing of the Prophet's Message and the goodness of his prophecy, they were elevated to the status of the Awliya' (loyal friends of Allah) and the rank of the scholars. Hence, they acquired the deepest knowledge among the people, the most pious hearts, and the most truthful tongues.

The Messenger also takes them away from the darkness (of disbelief) to the light (of faith) and teaches them the Book, the Qur'an, and the Hikmah (i.e., the wisdom), which is his Sunnah. He also teaches them what they knew not. During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to utter foolish statements. Later on, and with the blessing of the Prophet's Message and the goodness of his prophecy, they were elevated to the status of the Awliya' (loyal friends of Allah) and the rank of the scholars.

      "text": "<h2>The Meaning of \"it is not a sin\" in the Ayah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad reported that `Urwah said that he asked `A'ishah about what Allah stated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ اللَّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا</div><p>(Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or `Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah).) \"By Allah! It is not a sin if someone did not perform Tawaf around them.\" `A'ishah said, \"Worst is that which you said, O my nephew! If this is the meaning of it, it should have read, `It is not a sin if one did not perform Tawaf around them.' Rather, the Ayah was revealed regarding the Ansar, who before Islam, used to assume Ihlal (or Ihram for Hajj) in the area of Mushallal for their idol Manat that they used to worship. Those who assumed Ihlal for Manat, used to hesitate to perform Tawaf (going) between Mounts As-Safa and Al-Marwah. So they (during the Islamic era) asked Allah's Messenger about it, saying, `O Messenger of Allah! During the time of Jahiliyyah, we used to hesitate to perform Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwah.' Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ اللَّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا</div><p>(Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah are of the symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or `Umrah of the House to perform the going (Tawaf) between them.)\" `A'ishah then said, \" Allah's Messenger has made it the Sunnah to perform Tawaf between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah), and thus, no one should abandon performing Tawaf between them.\" This Hadith is reported in the Sahihayn. </p><p>In another narration, Imam Az-Zuhri reported that `Urwah said: Later on I (`Urwah) told Abu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham (of `A'ishah's statement) and he said, \"I have not heard of such information. However, I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom `A'ishah mentioned, said, `Our Tawaf between these two hills is a practice of Jahiliyyah. ' Some others among the Ansar said, `We were commanded to perform Tawaf of the Ka`bah, but not between As-Safa and Al-Marwah.' So Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah are of the symbols of Allah.)\" Abu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman then said, \"It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups.\" Al-Bukhari collected a similar narration by Anas. </p><p>Ash-Sha`bi said, \"Isaf (an idol) was on As-Safa while Na'ilah (an idol) was on Al-Marwah, and they used to touch (or kiss) them. After Islam came, they were hesitant about performing Tawaf between them. Thereafter, the Ayah (2:158 above) was revealed.\" </p><h2>The Wisdom behind legislating Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah</h2><p>Muslim recorded a long Hadith in his Sahih from Jabir, in which Allah's Messenger finished the Tawaf around the House, and then went back to the Rukn (pillar, i.e., the Black Stone) and kissed it. He then went out from the door near As-Safa while reciting: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah are of the symbols of Allah.) The Prophet then said, (I start with what Allah has commanded me to start with meaning start the Sa`i (i.e., fast walking) from the As-Safa). In another narration of An-Nasa'i, the Prophet said, (Start with what Allah has started with (i.e., As-Safa).) </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Habibah bint Abu Tajrah said, \"I saw Allah's Messenger performing Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwah, while the people were in front of him and he was behind them walking in Sa`i. I saw his garment twisted around his knees because of the fast walking in Sa`i (he was performing) and he was reciting: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اسْعَوْا فَإِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ السَّعْي».</div><p>(Perform Sa`i, for Allah has prescribed Sa`i on you.)\"' </p><p>This Hadith was used as a proof for the fact that Sa`i is a Rukn of Hajj. It was also said that Sa`i is Wajib, and not a Rukn of Hajj and that if one does not perform it by mistake or by intention, he could expiate the shortcoming with Damm. Allah has stated that Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwah is among the symbols of Allah, meaning, among the acts that Allah legislated during the Hajj for Prophet Ibrahim. </p><p>Earlier we mentioned the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that the origin of Tawaf comes from the Tawaf of Hajar (Prophet Ibrahim's wife), between As-Safa and Al-Marwah seeking water for her son (Isma`il) Ibrahim had left them in Makkah, where there was no habitation for her. When Hajar feared that her son would die, she stood up and begged Allah for His help and kept going back and forth in that blessed area between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. She was humble, fearful, frightened and meek before Allah. Allah answered her prayers, relieved her of her loneliness, ended her dilemma and made the well of Zamzam bring forth its water for her, which is: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«طَعَامُ طُعْمٍ،وَشِفَاءُ سُقْم»</div><p>(A tasty (or nutritional) food and a remedy for the illness.) </p><p>Therefore, whoever performs Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah should remember his meekness, humbleness and need for Allah to guide his heart, lead his affairs to success and forgive his sins. He should also want Allah to eliminate his shortcomings and errors and to guide him to the straight path. He should ask Allah to keep him firm on this path until he meets death, and to change his situation from that of sin and errors to that of perfection and being forgiven, --- the same providence which was provided to Hajar. </p><p>Allah then states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا</div><p>(And whoever does good voluntarily.) </p><p>It was said that the Ayah describes performing Tawaf more than seven times, it was also said that it refers to voluntary `Umrah or Hajj. It was also said that it means volunteering to do good works in general, as Ar-Razi has stated. The third opinion was attributed to Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(...then verily, Allah is All-Recognizer, All-Knower.) meaning, Allah's reward is immense for the little deed, and He knows about the sufficiency of the reward. Hence, He will not award insufficient rewards to anyone. Indeed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً </div><p>(Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.)

      "text": "<h2>The Condition of the Polytheists in this Life and the Hereafter</h2><p>In these Ayat, Allah mentions the condition of the polytheists in this life and their destination in the Hereafter. They appointed equals and rivals with Allah, worshipping them along with Allah and loving them, just as they love Allah. However, Allah is the only deity worthy of worship, Who has neither rival nor opponent nor partner. It is reported in the Sahihayn that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What is the greatest sin\" He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»</div><p>(To appoint a rival to Allah while He Alone has created you.) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِلَّهِ</div><p>(But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)) </p><p>Because these believers love Allah, know His greatness, revere Him, believe in His Oneness, then they do not associate anything or anyone with Him in the worship. Rather, they worship Him Alone, depend on Him and they seek help from Him for each and every need. </p><p>Then, Allah warns those who commit Shirk, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ يَرَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ أَنَّ الْقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا</div><p>(If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to Allah.) if these people knew what they will face and the terrible punishment they are to suffer because of their disbelief and Shirk (polytheism), then they would shun the deviation that they live by. </p><p>Allah mentions their false beliefs in their idols, and that those they followed will declare their innocence of them. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ</div><p>(When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed (them).) the angels, whom they used to claim that they worshipped, declare their innocence of them in the Hereafter, saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَبَرَّأْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كَانُواْ إِيَّانَا يَعْبُدُونَ</div><p>(We declare our innocence (from them) before You. It was not us they worshipped.) (28:63), and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَكَ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِمْ بَلْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ الْجِنَّ أَكْـثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>(\"Glorified be You! You are our Wali (Lord) instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn; most of them were believers in them.\") (34:4) </p><p>The Jinn will also disown the disbelievers who worshipped them, and they will reject that worship. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5, 6) Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً </div><p>(And they have taken (for worship) alihah (gods) besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory (and also protect them from Allah' punishment). Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them (on the Day of Resurrection).) (19:81, 82) Prophet Ibrahim said to his people: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25) Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ مَوْقُوفُونَ عِندَ رَبّهِمْ يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ الْقَوْلَ يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ لَوْلاَ أَنتُمْ لَكُنَّا مُؤْمِنِينَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ أَنَحْنُ صَدَدنَـكُمْ عَنِ الْهُدَى بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءكُمْ بَلْ كُنتُمْ مُّجْرِمِينَ وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ بَلْ مَكْرُ الَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَآ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِاللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُ أَندَاداً وَأَسَرُّواْ النَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ اْلَعَذَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا الاْغْلَـلَ فِى أَعْنَاقِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(But if you could see when the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) will be made to stand before their Lord,how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!\" And those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak: \"Did we keep you back from guidance after it had come to you Nay, but you were Mujrimin (polytheists, sinners, disbelievers, criminals).\" Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!\" And each of them (parties) will conceal their own regrets (for disobeying Allah during this worldly life), when they behold the torment. And We shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught except what they used to do) (34:31-33) Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَـنُ لَمَّا قُضِىَ الاٌّمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى فَلاَ تَلُومُونِى وَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ مَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِىَّ إِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ إِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ </div><p>(And Shaytan (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: \"Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers).) (14:22) </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ</div><p>(...and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.) meaning, when they see Allah's torment, their power and means of salvation are all cut off, and they will have no way of making amends, nor will they find a way of escape from the Fire. `Ata' reported that Ibn `Abbas said about: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ</div><p>(then all their relations will be cut off from them.) \"meaning the friendship.\" Mujahid reported a similar statement in another narration by Ibn Abu Najih. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا</div><p>(And those who followed will say: \"If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves as innocent from) them as they have disowned (declared themselves as innocent from) us.\") </p><p>This Ayah means: `If we only had a chance to go back to the life so that we could disown them (their idols, leaders, etc.) shun their worship, ignore them and worship Allah Alone instead.' But they utter a lie in this regard, because if they were given the chance to go back, they would only return to what they were prohibited from doing, just as Allah said. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ اللَّهُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ حَسَرَتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them.) meaning, their works will vanish and disappear. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً </div><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) (25:23) </p><p>Allah also said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ</div><p>(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day.) (14:18), and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً</div><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water.) (24:39) </p><p>This is why Allah said ـ at the end of the Ayah 2:167 above </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ</div><p>(And they will never get out of the Fire.) </p>"

Dead animals are those that die before being slaughtered; whether they die by strangling, a violent blow, a headlong fall, the goring of horns or by being partly eaten by a wild animal.

They concealed this information so that they would not lose authority and the position that they had with the Arabs, where they would bring them gifts, and honor them. The cursed Jews feared that if they announced what they know about Muhammad , then the people would abandon them and follow him. So they hid the truth so that they may retain the little that they were getting, and they sold their souls for this little profit. They preferred the little that they gained over guidance and following the truth, believing in the Messenger and having faith in what Allah was sent him with. Therefore, they have profited failure and loss in this life and the Hereafter. </p><p>As for this world, Allah made the truth about His Messenger known anyway, by the clear signs and the unequivocal proofs. Thereafter, those whom the Jews feared would follow the Prophet , believed in him and followed him anyway, and so they became his supporters against them. Thus, the Jews earned anger on top of the wrath that they already had earned before, and Allah criticized them again many times in His Book. For instance, Allah said in this Ayah (2:174 above): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْكِتَـبِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيًلا</div><p>(Verily, those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small gain therewith (of worldly things).) meaning, the joys and delights of this earthly life. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلاَّ النَّارَ</div><p>(...they eat into their bellies nothing but fire,) meaning, whatever they eat in return for hiding the truth, will turn into a raging fire in their stomachs on the Day of Resurrection. </p><p>Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَلَ الْيَتَـمَى ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِى بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً </div><p>(Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!) (4:10) </p><p>Also, reported in an authentic Hadith is that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الَّذِي يَأْكُلُ أَوْ يَشْرَبُ فِي آنِيةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ إنَّمَا يُجَرْجِرُ فِي بَطْنِهِ نَارَ جَهَنَّم»</div><p>(Those who eat or drink in golden or silver plates are filling their stomachs with the fire of Jahannam (Hell).) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment.) </p><p>This is because Allah is furious with them for concealing the truth. They thus deserve Allah's anger, so Allah will not look at them or purify them, meaning that He will not praise them but will cause them to taste a severe torment. Then, Allah said about them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُاْ الضَّلَـلَةَ بِالْهُدَى</div><p>(Those are they who have purchased error for guidance.) </p><p>Hence, they opposed the guidance, that is, not announcing the Prophet's description they find in their Books, the news about his prophecy and the good news of his coming which the previous Prophets proclaimed, as well as following and believing in him. Instead, they preferred misguidance by denying him, rejecting him and concealing his descriptions that were mentioned in their Books. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَذَابَ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ</div><p>(...and torment at the price of forgiveness,) meaning, they preferred torment over forgiveness due to the sins they have committed. Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَآ أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ</div><p>(So how bold they are (for evil deeds which will push them) to the Fire.) </p><p>Allah states that they will suffer such severe, painful torment that those who see them will be amazed at how they could bear the tremendous punishment, torture and pain that they will suffer. We seek refuge with Allah from this evil end. RAllah's Statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ نَزَّلَ الْكِتَـبَ بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) in truth. ) means, they deserve this painful torment because Allah has revealed Books to His Messenger Muhammad , and the Prophets before him, and these revelations bring about truth and expose falsehood. Yet, they took Allah's signs for mockery. Their Books ordered them to announce the truth and to spread the knowledge, but instead, they defied the knowledge and rejected it. This Final Messenger ـ Muhammad ـ called them to Allah, commanded them to work righteousness and forbade them from committing evil. Yet, they rejected, denied and defied him and hid the truth that they knew about him. They, thus, mocked the Ayat that Allah revealed to His Messengers, and this is why they deserved the torment and the punishment. This is why Allah said here (2:176): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ نَزَّلَ الْكِتَـبَ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُواْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ لَفِى شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ </div><p>(That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) in truth. And verily, those who disputed about the Book are far away in opposition.) </p>"

For instance, Allah said in this Ayah (2:174 above): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْكِتَـبِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيًلا</div><p>(Verily, those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small gain therewith (of worldly things).) meaning, the joys and delights of this earthly life. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلاَّ النَّارَ</div><p>(...they eat into their bellies nothing but fire,) meaning, whatever they eat in return for hiding the truth, will turn into a raging fire in their stomachs on the Day of Resurrection. </p><p>Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَلَ الْيَتَـمَى ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِى بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً </div><p>(Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!) (4:10) </p><p>Also, reported in an authentic Hadith is that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الَّذِي يَأْكُلُ أَوْ يَشْرَبُ فِي آنِيةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ إنَّمَا يُجَرْجِرُ فِي بَطْنِهِ نَارَ جَهَنَّم»</div><p>(Those who eat or drink in golden or silver plates are filling their stomachs with the fire of Jahannam (Hell).) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment.) </p><p>This is because Allah is furious with them for concealing the truth. They thus deserve Allah's anger, so Allah will not look at them or purify them, meaning that He will not praise them but will cause them to taste a severe torment. Then, Allah said about them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ اشْتَرَوُاْ الضَّلَـلَةَ بِالْهُدَى</div><p>(Those are they who have purchased error for guidance.) </p><p>Hence, they opposed the guidance, that is, not announcing the Prophet's description they find in their Books, the news about his prophecy and the good news of his coming which the previous Prophets proclaimed, as well as following and believing in him. Instead, they preferred misguidance by denying him, rejecting him and concealing his descriptions that were mentioned in their Books. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْعَذَابَ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ</div><p>(...and torment at the price of forgiveness,) meaning, they preferred torment over forgiveness due to the sins they have committed.

Yet, they took Allah's signs for mockery. Their Books ordered them to announce the truth and to spread the knowledge, but instead, they defied the knowledge and rejected it. This Final Messenger ـ Muhammad ـ called them to Allah, commanded them to work righteousness and forbade them from committing evil. Yet, they rejected, denied and defied him and hid the truth that they knew about him. They, thus, mocked the Ayat that Allah revealed to His Messengers, and this is why they deserved the torment and the punishment. This is why Allah said here (2:176): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ نَزَّلَ الْكِتَـبَ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُواْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ لَفِى شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ </div><p>(That is because Allah has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) in truth.

      "text": "<h2>Al-Birr (Piety, Righteousness)</h2><p>This Ayah contains many great wisdoms, encompassing rulings and correct beliefs. </p><p>As for the explanation of this Ayah, Allah first commanded the believers to face Bayt Al-Maqdis, and then to face the Ka`bah during the prayer. This change was difficult for some of the People of the Book, and even for some Muslims. Then Allah sent revelation which clarified the wisdom behind this command, that is, obedience to Allah, adhering to His commands, facing wherever He commands facing, and implementing whatever He legislates, that is the objective. This is Birr, Taqwa and complete faith. Facing the east or the west does not necessitate righteousness or obedience, unless it is legislated by Allah. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Birr is the one who believes in Allah and the Last Day,) </p><p>Similarly, Allah said about the sacrifices: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ</div><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is the piety from you that reaches Him.) (22:37) </p><p>Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"The Jews used to face the west for their Qiblah, while the Christians used to face the east for their Qiblah. So Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ</div><p>(It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers)) (2: 177) meaning, \"this is faith, and its essence requires implementation.\" Similar was reported from Al-Hasan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ath-Thawri recited: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(but Birr is the one who believes in Allah,) and said that what follows are the types of Birr. He has said the truth. Certainly, those who acquire the qualities mentioned in the Ayah will have indeed embraced all aspects of Islam and implemented all types of righteousness; believing in Allah, that He is the only God worthy of worship, and believing in the angels the emissaries between Allah and His Messengers. </p><p>The `Books' are the Divinely revealed Books from Allah to the Prophets, which were finalized by the most honorable Book (the Qur'an). The Qur'an supercedes all previous Books, it mentions all types of righteousness, and the way to happiness in this life and the Hereafter. The Qur'an abrogates all previous Books and testfies to all of Allah's Prophets, from the first Prophet to the Final Prophet, Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَى الْمَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ</div><p>(...and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it,) refers to those who give money away while desiring it and loving it. It is recorded in the Sahihayn that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقةِ أَنْ تَصَدَّقَ وَأَنْتَ صَحِيحٌ شَحِيحٌ، تَأْمُلُ الْغِنَى وتَخْشَى الْفقْر»</div><p>(The best charity is when you give it away while still healthy and thrifty, hoping to get rich and fearing poverty.) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُطْعِمُونَ الطَّعَامَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ مِسْكِيناً وَيَتِيماً وَأَسِيراً - إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ لاَ نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءً وَلاَ شُكُوراً </div><p>(And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive (saying): \"We feed you seeking Allah's Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you.\") (76:8, 9) </p><p>and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ</div><p>(By no means shall you attain Birr unless you spend of that which you love.) (3:92) Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ</div><p>(...and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that) (59:9) refers to a higher category and status, as the people mentioned here give away what they need, while those mentioned in the previous Ayat give away what they covet (but not necessarily need). </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَوِى الْقُرْبَى</div><p>(the kinsfolk) refers to man's relatives, who have more rights than anyone else to one's charity, as the Hadith supports: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الصَّدَقَةُ عَلَى الْمَسَاكِينِ صَدَقَةٌ، وعَلَى ذِي الرَّحِمِ اثْنتَانِ: صَدَقَةٌ وَصِلَـةٌ، فَهُمْ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِكَ وَبِبِرِّكَ وَإِعْطَائِك»</div><p>(Sadaqah (i. e., charity) given to the poor is a charity, while the Sadaqah given to the relatives is both Sadaqah and Silah (nurturing relations), for they are the most deserving of you and your kindness and charity). </p><p>Allah has commanded kindness to the relatives in many places in the Qur'an. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْيَتَـمَى</div><p>(to the orphans) The orphans are children who have none to look after them, having lost their fathers while they are still young, weak and unable to find their own sustenance since they have not reached the age of work and adolescence. `Abdur-Razzaq reported that `Ali said that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمَسَـكِينُ</div><p>(and to Al-Masakin) The Miskin is the person who does not have enough food, clothing, or he has no dwelling. So the Miskin should be granted the provisions to sustain him enough so that he can acquire his needs. In the Sahihayn it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّه التَّمْرَةُ والتَّمْرَتَانِ، واللُّقْمَةُ واللُّقْمَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيه وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتصَدَّقَ عَلَيْه»</div><p>(The Miskin is not the person who roams around, and whose need is met by one or two dates or one or two bites. Rather, the Miskin is he who does not have what is sufficient, and to whom the people do not pay attention and, thus, do not give him from the charity.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(and to the wayfarer) is the needy traveler who runs out of money and should, thus, be granted whatever amount that helps him to go back to his land. Such is the case with whoever intends to go on a permissible journey, he is given what he needs for his journey and back. The guests are included in this category. `Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ibn As-Sabil (wayfarer) is the guest who is hosted by Muslims.\" Furthermore, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Muqatil bin Hayyan said similarly. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّآئِلِينَ</div><p>(and to those who ask) refers to those who beg people and are thus given a part of the Zakah and general charity. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِي الرِّقَابِ</div><p>(and to set servants free) These are the servants who seek to free themselves, but cannot find enough money to buy their freedom. We will mention several of these categories and types under the Tafsir of the Ayah on Sadaqah in Surat Bara'ah chapter 9 in the Qur'an, In sha' Allah. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ</div><p>(performs As-Salah (Iqamat-As-Salah)) means those who pray on time and give the prayer its due right; the bowing, prostration, and the necessary attention and humbleness required by Allah. Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَى الزَّكَوةَ</div><p>(and gives the Zakah) means the required charity (Zakah) due on one's money, as Sa`id bin Jubayr and Muqatil bin Hayyan have stated. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَـهَدُواْ</div><p>(and who fulfill their covenant when they make it,) </p><p>is similar to: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلاَ يِنقُضُونَ الْمِيثَـقَ </div><p>(Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the Mithaq (bond, treaty, covenant).) (13:20) </p><p>The opposite of this characteristic is hypocrisy. As found in a Hadith: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَان»</div><p>(The signs of a hypocrite are three: if he speaks, he lies; if he promises, he breaks his promise; and if he is entrusted, he breaches the trust.) </p><p>In another version: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإذَا عَاهَدَ غَدَرَ،وَإذَا خَاصَمَ فَجَر»</div><p>(If he speaks, he lies; if he vows, he breaks his vow; and if he disputes, he is lewd.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِى الْبَأْسَآءِ والضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ</div><p>(. ..and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles).) means, during the time of meekness and ailment. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ</div><p>(...and at the time of fighting (during the battles).) means on the battlefield while facing the enemy, as Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Murrah Al-Hamdani, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak and others have stated. </p><p>And calling them the patient here, is a form of praise, because of the importance of patience in these circumstances, and the suffering and difficulties that accompany them.

      "text": "<h2>The Command and the Wisdom behind the Law of Equality</h2><p>Allah states: O believers! The Law of equality has been ordained on you (for cases of murder), the free for the free, the slave for the slave and the female for the female. Therefore, do not transgress the set limits, as others before you transgressed them, and thus changed what Allah has ordained for them. The reason behind this statement is that (the Jewish tribe of) Banu An-Nadir invaded Qurayzah (another Jewish tribe) during the time of Jahiliyyah (before Islam) and defeated them. Hence, (they made it a law that) when a person from Nadir kills a person from Quraizah, he is not killed in retaliation, but only pays a hundred Wasq of dates. However, when a person from Quraizah kills a Nadir man, he would be killed for him. If Nadir wanted (to forfeit the execution of the murderer and instead require him) to pay a ransom, the Quraizah man pays two hundred Wasq of dates double the amount Nadir pays in Diyah (blood money). So Allah commanded that justice be observed regarding the penal code, and that the path of the misguided and mischievous persons be avoided, who in disbelief and transgression, defy and alter what Allah has commanded them. Allah said: </p>\n\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\"> كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ</div>\n\n<p>(Al-Qisas (the Law of equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ</div>\n<p>(the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.) was abrogated by the statement life for life (5:45). However, the majority of scholars agree that the Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever whom he kills. Al- Bukhari reported that `Ali narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَلَا يُقْتَلُ مُسْلِمٌ بِكَافِر»</div><p>(The Muslim is not killed for the disbeliever (whom he kills).) </p><p>No opinion that opposes this ruling could stand correct, nor is there an authentic Hadith to contradict it. However, Abu Hanifah thought that the Muslim could be killed for a disbeliever, following the general meaning of the Ayah (5:45) in Surat Al-Ma'idah (chapter 5 in the Qur'an). </p><p>The Four Imams (Abu Hanifah, Malik, Shafi`i and Ahmad) and the majority of scholars stated that the group is killed for one person whom they murder. `Umar said, about a boy who was killed by seven men, \"If all the residents of San`a' (capital of Yemen today) collaborated on killing him, I would kill them all.\" No opposing opinion was known by the Companions during that time which constitutes a near Ijma` (consensus). There is an opinion attributed to Imam Ahmad that a group of people is not killed for one person whom they kill, and that only one person is killed for one person. Ibn Al-Mundhir also attributed this opinion to Mu`adh, Ibn Az-Zubayr, `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan, Az-Zuhri, Ibn Sirin and Habib bin Abu Thabit.

      "text": "<h2>The Command and the Wisdom behind the Law of Equality</h2><p>Allah states: O believers! The Law of equality has been ordained on you (for cases of murder), the free for the free, the slave for the slave and the female for the female. Therefore, do not transgress the set limits, as others before you transgressed them, and thus changed what Allah has ordained for them. The reason behind this statement is that (the Jewish tribe of) Banu An-Nadir invaded Qurayzah (another Jewish tribe) during the time of Jahiliyyah (before Islam) and defeated them. Hence, (they made it a law that) when a person from Nadir kills a person from Quraizah, he is not killed in retaliation, but only pays a hundred Wasq of dates. However, when a person from Quraizah kills a Nadir man, he would be killed for him. If Nadir wanted (to forfeit the execution of the murderer and instead require him) to pay a ransom, the Quraizah man pays two hundred Wasq of dates double the amount Nadir pays in Diyah (blood money). So Allah commanded that justice be observed regarding the penal code, and that the path of the misguided and mischievous persons be avoided, who in disbelief and transgression, defy and alter what Allah has commanded them. Allah said: </p>\n\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\"> كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ</div>\n\n<p>(Al-Qisas (the Law of equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ</div>\n<p>(the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.) was abrogated by the statement life for life (5:45). However, the majority of scholars agree that the Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever whom he kills. Al- Bukhari reported that `Ali narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَلَا يُقْتَلُ مُسْلِمٌ بِكَافِر»</div><p>(The Muslim is not killed for the disbeliever (whom he kills).) </p><p>No opinion that opposes this ruling could stand correct, nor is there an authentic Hadith to contradict it. However, Abu Hanifah thought that the Muslim could be killed for a disbeliever, following the general meaning of the Ayah (5:45) in Surat Al-Ma'idah (chapter 5 in the Qur'an). </p><p>The Four Imams (Abu Hanifah, Malik, Shafi`i and Ahmad) and the majority of scholars stated that the group is killed for one person whom they murder. `Umar said, about a boy who was killed by seven men, \"If all the residents of San`a' (capital of Yemen today) collaborated on killing him, I would kill them all.\" No opposing opinion was known by the Companions during that time which constitutes a near Ijma` (consensus). There is an opinion attributed to Imam Ahmad that a group of people is not killed for one person whom they kill, and that only one person is killed for one person. Ibn Al-Mundhir also attributed this opinion to Mu`adh, Ibn Az-Zubayr, `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan, Az-Zuhri, Ibn Sirin and Habib bin Abu Thabit. Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ عُفِىَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَىْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَآءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَـنٍ</div><p>(But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives) of the killed (against blood money), then it should be sought in a good manner, and paid to him respectfully.) refers to accepting blood money (by the relatives of the victim in return for pardoning the killer) in cases of intentional murder.

When the Ayah of inheritance was revealed, this Ayah was abrogated, so fixed shares of the inheritance for deserving recipients were legislated by Allah. Therefore, deserving inheritors take their fixed inheritance without the need to be included in the will or to be reminded of the favor of the inherited person. For this reason we see the Hadith narrated in the Sunan and other books that `Amr bin Kharijah said: I heard Allah's Messenger saying in a speech: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَعْطَى كُلَّ ذِي حَقَ حَقَّهُ، فَلَا وَصِيَّــةَ لِوَارِث»</div><p>(Allah has given each heir his fixed share.

Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Tawus, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Shurayh, Ad-Dahhak and Az-Zuhri said that this Ayah (2:180 above) was abrogated by the Ayah about the inheritors (4:7).\" </p><h2>The Will for the Relatives that do not qualify as Inheritors</h2><p>It is recommended that the remaining relatives who do not have a designated fixed share of the inheritance, be willed up to a third, due to the general meaning of the Ayah about the will. It is recorded in the Sahihayn that Ibn `Umar said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا حَقُّ امْرِىءٍ مُسْلِمٍ لَهُ شَيْءٌ يُوصِي فِيه يَبِيتُ لَيْلَتَيْنِ إلَّا وَوَصِيَّتُهُ مَكْتُوبَةٌ عِنْدَه»</div><p>(It is not permissible for any Muslim who has something to will to stay for two nights without having his last will and testament written and kept ready with him.) </p><p>Ibn `Umar commented, \"Ever since I heard this statement from Allah's Messenger , no night has passed, but my will is kept ready with me.\" There are many other Ayat and Ahadith ordering kindness and generosity to one's relatives. </p><h2>The Will should observe Justice</h2><p>The will should be fair, in that one designates a part of the inheritance to his relatives without committing injustice against his qualified inheritors and without extravagance or stinginess. It is recorded in the Sahihayn that Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I have some money and only a daughter inherits from me, should I will all my remaining property (to others)\" He said, \"No.\" Sa`d said, \"Then may I will half of it\" He said, \"No.\" Sa`d said, \"One-third\" He said, \"Yes, one-third, yet even one-third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.\" Al-Bukhari mentioned in his Sahih that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I recommend that people reduce the proportion of what they bequeath by will to a fourth (of the whole legacy) rather than a third, for Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الثُّلُثُ وَالثُّلُثُ كَثِير»</div><p>(One-third, yet even one-third is too much.)\" </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَمَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَآ إِثْمُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ </div><p>(Then whoever changes it after hearing it, the sin shall be on those who make the change.

Or, the testator might include his daughter's son in the legacy to increase his daughter's share in the inheritance, and so forth. Such errors might occur out of the kindness of the heart without thinking about the consequences of these actions, or by sinful intention. In such cases, the executive of the will and testament is allowed to correct the errors and to replace the unjust items in the will with a better solution, so that both the Islamic law and what the dead person had wished for are respected and observed. This act would not constitute an alteration in the will and this is why Allah mentioned it specifically, so that it is excluded from the prohibition (that prohibits altering the will and testament) mentioned in the previous Ayah. And Allah knows best. </p>  <p>`Abdur-Razzaq reported that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَعْمَلُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْخَيْرِ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً، فَإِذَا أَوْصَى حَافَ فِي وَصِيَّتِهِ، فَيُخْتَمُ لَه بِشَرِّ عَمَلِهِ، فَيَدْخُلُ النَّارَ. وَإِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَعْمَلُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الشَّرِّ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً، فَيَعْدِلُ فِي وَصِيَّتِهِ، فَيُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِخَيْرِ عَمَلِهِ، فَيَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّــة»</div><p>(A man might perform the works of righteous people for seventy years, but when he dictates his will, he commits injustice and thus his works end with the worst of his deeds and he enters the Fire.

When the Ayah of inheritance was revealed, this Ayah was abrogated, so fixed shares of the inheritance for deserving recipients were legislated by Allah. Therefore, deserving inheritors take their fixed inheritance without the need to be included in the will or to be reminded of the favor of the inherited person. For this reason we see the Hadith narrated in the Sunan and other books that `Amr bin Kharijah said: I heard Allah's Messenger saying in a speech: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَعْطَى كُلَّ ذِي حَقَ حَقَّهُ، فَلَا وَصِيَّــةَ لِوَارِث»</div><p>(Allah has given each heir his fixed share.

      "text": "<h2>The Order to Fast</h2><p>In an address to the believers of this Ummah, Allah ordered them to fast, that is, to abstain from food, drink and sexual activity with the intention of doing so sincerely for Allah the Exalted alone. This is because fasting purifies the souls and cleanses them from the evil that might mix with them and their ill behavior. Allah mentioned that He has ordained fasting for Muslims just as He ordained it for those before them, they being an example for them in that, so they should vigorously perform this obligation more obediently than the previous nations. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَـجاً وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَـكُم فَاسْتَبِقُوا الخَيْرَاتِ</div><p>(To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so compete in good deeds.) (5:48) </p><p>Allah said in this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ </div><p>(O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may have Taqwa).) since the fast cleanses the body and narrows the paths of Shaytan. In the Sahihayn the following Hadith was recorded: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا مَعْشَرَ الشَّبَابِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمُ الْبَاءَةَ فَلْيتَـزَوَّجْ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِع فَعَلَيْهِ بِالصَّوْمِ فَإِنَّهُ لَهُ وِجَاء»</div><p>.(O young people! Whoever amongst you can afford marriage, let him marry. Whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.) </p><p>Allah then states that the fast occurs during a fixed number of days, so that it does not become hard on the hearts, thereby weakening their resolve and endurance.) </p><h2>The various Stages of Fasting</h2><p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said, \"(The day of) `Ashura' was a day of fasting. When the obligation to fast Ramadan was revealed, those who wished fasted, and those who wished did not.\" Al-Bukhari recorded the same from Ibn `Umar and Ibn Mas`ud. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ</div><p>(...those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).) </p><p>Mu`adh commented, \"In the beginning, those who wished, fasted and those who wished, did not fast and fed a poor person for each day.\" Al- Bukhari recorded Salamah bin Al-Akwa` saying that when the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ</div><p>(...those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).) was revealed, those who did not wish to fast, used to pay the Fidyah (feeding a poor person for each day they did not fast) until the following Ayah (2:185) was revealed abrogating the previous Ayah. It was also reported from `Ubaydullah from Nafi` that Ibn `Umar said; \"It was abrogated.\" As-Suddi reported that Murrah narrated that `Abdullah said about this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ</div><p>(those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).) \"It means `those who find it difficult (to fast).' Formerly, those who wished, fasted and those who wished, did not but fed a poor person instead.\" Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا</div><p>(But whoever does good of his own accord) meaning whoever fed an extra poor person, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ وَأَن تَصُومُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you) Later the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ</div><p>(So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasting) that month) (2:185) was revealed and this abrogated the previous Ayah (2:184). </p><h2>The Fidyah (Expiation) for breaking the Fast is for the Old and the Ailing</h2><p>Al-Bukhari reported that `Ata heard Ibn `Abbas recite: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ</div><p>(And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas then commented, \"(This Ayah) was not abrogated, it is for the old man and the old woman who are able to fast with difficulty, but choose instead to feed a poor person for every day (they do not fast).\" Others reported that Sa`id bin Jubayr mentioned this from Ibn `Abbas. So the abrogation here applies to the healthy person, who is not traveling and who has to fast, as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ</div><p>(So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasting) that month.) (2:185) </p><p>As for the old man (and woman) who cannot fast, he is allowed to abstain from fasting and does not have to fast another day instead, because he is not likely to improve and be able to fast other days. So he is required to pay a Fidyah for every day missed. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas and several others among the Salaf who read the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ</div><p>(And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man)) to mean those who find it difficult to fast as Ibn Mas`ud stated. This is also the opinion of Al-Bukhari who said, \"As for the old man (person) who cannot fast, (he should do like) Anas who, for one or two years after he became old fed some bread and meat to a poor person for each day he did not fast.\" </p><p>This point, which Al-Bukhari attributed to Anas without a chain of narrators, was collected with a continuous chain of narrators by Abu Ya`la Mawsuli in his Musnad, that Ayyub bin Abu Tamimah said; \"Anas could no longer fast. So he made a plate of Tharid (broth, bread and meat) and invited thirty poor persons and fed them.\" The same ruling applies for the pregnant and breast-feeding women if they fear for themselves or their children or fetuses. In this case, they pay the Fidyah and do not have to fast other days in place of the days that they missed. </p>"

And that you fast is better for you) Later the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ</div><p>(So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasting) that month) (2:185) was revealed and this abrogated the previous Ayah (2:184). </p><h2>The Fidyah (Expiation) for breaking the Fast is for the Old and the Ailing</h2><p>Al-Bukhari reported that `Ata heard Ibn `Abbas recite: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ</div><p>(And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas then commented, \"(This Ayah) was not abrogated, it is for the old man and the old woman who are able to fast with difficulty, but choose instead to feed a poor person for every day (they do not fast).\" Others reported that Sa`id bin Jubayr mentioned this from Ibn `Abbas. So the abrogation here applies to the healthy person, who is not traveling and who has to fast, as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ</div><p>(So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasting) that month.) (2:185) </p><p>As for the old man (and woman) who cannot fast, he is allowed to abstain from fasting and does not have to fast another day instead, because he is not likely to improve and be able to fast other days. So he is required to pay a Fidyah for every day missed. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas and several others among the Salaf who read the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ</div><p>(And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g., an old man)) to mean those who find it difficult to fast as Ibn Mas`ud stated. This is also the opinion of Al-Bukhari who said, \"As for the old man (person) who cannot fast, (he should do like) Anas who, for one or two years after he became old fed some bread and meat to a poor person for each day he did not fast.\" </p><p>This point, which Al-Bukhari attributed to Anas without a chain of narrators, was collected with a continuous chain of narrators by Abu Ya`la Mawsuli in his Musnad, that Ayyub bin Abu Tamimah said; \"Anas could no longer fast. So he made a plate of Tharid (broth, bread and meat) and invited thirty poor persons and fed them.\" The same ruling applies for the pregnant and breast-feeding women if they fear for themselves or their children or fetuses. In this case, they pay the Fidyah and do not have to fast other days in place of the days that they missed. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Virtue of Ramadan and the Revelation of the Qur'an in it.</h2><p>Allah praised the month of Ramadan out of the other months by choosing it to send down the Glorious Qur'an, just as He did for all of the Divine Books He revealed to the Prophets. Imam Ahmad reported Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُنْزِلَتْ صُحُفُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي أَوَّلِ لَيْلَةٍ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ، وَأُنْزِلَتِ التَّوْرَاةُ لِسِتَ مَضَيْنَ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ، وَالْإِنْجِيلُ لِثَلاثَ عَشَرةَ خَلَتْ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ، وَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ الْقُرْآنَ لأَرْبَعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ خَلَتْ مِنْ رَمَضَان»</div><p>(The Suhuf (Pages) of Ibrahim were revealed during the first night of Ramadan. The Torah was revealed during the sixth night of Ramadan. The Injil was revealed during the thirteenth night of Ramadan. Allah revealed the Qur'an on the twenty-fourth night of Ramadan.) </p><h2>The Virtues of the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الْهُدَى وَالْفُرْقَانِ</div><p>(...a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).) </p><p>Here Allah praised the Qur'an, which He revealed as guidance for the hearts of those who believe in it and adhere to its commands. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَيِّنَـتٍ</div><p>(and clear proofs) meaning, as clear and unambiguous signs and unequivocal proof for those who understand them. These proofs testify to the truth of the Qur'an, its guidance, the opposite of misguidance, and how it guides to the straight path, the opposite of the wrong path, and the distinction between the truth and falsehood, and the permissible and the prohibited. </p><h2>The Obligation of Fasting Ramadan</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ</div><p>(So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasting) that month.) </p><p>This Ayah requires the healthy persons who witness the beginning of the month, while residing in their land, to fast the month. This Ayah abrogated the Ayah that allows a choice of fasting or paying the Fidyah. When Allah ordered fasting, He again mentioned the permission for the ill person and the traveler to break the fast and to fast other days instead as compensation. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ</div><p>(...and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasting) must be made up from other days.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that ill persons who are unable to fast or fear harm by fasting, and the traveler, are all allowed to break the fast. When one does not fast in this case, he is obliged to fast other days instead. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلاَ يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ</div><p>(Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that Allah allowed such persons, out of His mercy and to make matters easy for them, to break the fast when they are ill or traveling, while the fast is still obligatory on the healthy persons who are not traveling. </p><h2>FASTING (rules)</h2><p>Question comes: \"What are some rulings concerning fasting? For instance, while traveling or on a journey or while under extreme conditions?\"</p><p>The authentic Sunnah states that Allah's Messenger traveled during the month of Ramadan for the battle for Makkah. The Prophet marched until he reached the area of Kadid and then broke his fast and ordered those who were with him to do likewise. This was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Breaking the fast mentioned in this Hadith was not required, for the Companions used to go out with Allah's Messenger during the month of Ramadan, then, some of them would fast while some of them would not fast and neither category would criticize the others. If the command mentioned in the Hadith required breaking the fast, the Prophet would have criticized those who fasted. Allah's Messenger himself sometimes fasted while traveling. For instance, it is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Ad-Darda' said, \"We once went with Allah's Messenger during Ramadan while the heat was intense. One of us would place his hand on his head because of the intense heat. Only Allah's Messenger and `Abdullah bin Rawahah were fasting at that time.\" </p><p>We should state that observing the permission to break the fast while traveling is better, as Allah's Messenger said about fasting while traveling: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَفْطَرَ فَحَسَنٌ، وَمَنْ صَامَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْه»</div><p>(Those who did not fast have done good, and there is no harm for those who fasted.) </p><p>In another Hadith, the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلَيْكُمْ بِرُخْصَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي رُخِّصَ لَكُم»</div><p>(Hold to Allah's permission that He has granted you.) </p><p>Some scholars say that the two actions are the same, as `A'ishah narrated that Hamzah bin `Amr Al-Aslami said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I fast a lot, should I fast while traveling\" The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنْ شِئْتَ فَصُمْ، وَإِنْ شِئْتَ فَأَفْطِر»</div><p>(Fast if you wish or do not fast if you wish.) </p><p>This Hadith is in the Two Sahihs. It was reported that if the fast becomes difficult (while traveling), then breaking the fast is better. Jabir said that Allah's Messenger saw a man who was being shaded (by other people while traveling). The Prophet asked about him and he was told that man was fasting. The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ مِنَ الْبِرِّ الصِّيَامُ فِي السَّفَر»</div><p>(It is not a part of Birr (piety) to fast while traveling.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p>As for those who ignore the Sunnah and believe in their hearts that breaking the fast while traveling is disliked, they are required to break the fast and are not allowed to fast. </p><p>As for making up for missed fasting days, it is not required to be consecutive. One may do so consecutively or not consecutively. There are ample proofs to this fact. We should mention that fasting consecutive days is only required exclusively during Ramadan. After the month of Ramadan, what is required then is to merely make up for missed days. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ</div><p>(. ..the same number (should be made up) from other days.) </p><h2>Ease and not Hardship</h2><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلاَ يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ</div><p>(Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded Anas bin Malik saying that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَسِّرُوا وَلَا تُعَسِّرُوا وَسَكِّنُوا وَلَا تُنَفِّرُوا»</div><p>(Treat the people with ease and don't be hard on them; give them glad tidings and don't fill them with aversion.) </p><p>This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. It is reported in the Sahihayn that Allah's Messenger said to Mu`adh and Abu Musa when he sent them to Yemen: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرَا، وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا، وَتَطَاوَعَا وَلَا تَخْتَلِفَا»</div><p>(Treat the people with ease and don't be hard on them; give them glad tidings and don't fill them with aversion; and love each other, and don't differ.) </p><p>The Sunan and the Musnad compilers recorded that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»</div><p>(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah (Islamic Monotheism).) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلاَ يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُواْ الْعِدَّةَ</div><p>(Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days)) means: You were allowed to break the fast while ill, while traveling, and so forth, because Allah wanted to make matters easy for you. He only commanded you to make up for missed days so that you complete the days of one month. </p><h2>Remembering Allah upon performing the Acts of Worship</h2><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ</div><p>(...and that you must magnify Allah i.e., to say Takbir (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great) for having guided you) means: So that you remember Allah upon finishing the act of worship. This is similar to Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُم مَّنَـسِكَكُمْ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ءَابَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا</div><p>(So when you have accomplished your Manasik, (rituals) remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with far more remembrance.) (2:200) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَوةُ فَانتَشِرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَابْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ </div><p>(...Then when the (Jumu`ah) Salah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the bounty of Allah (by working), and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.) (62:10) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْبِرْ عَلَى مَا يَقُولُونَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ الْغُرُوبِ - وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَأَدْبَـرَ السُّجُودِ </div><p>(...and glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting. And during a part of the night, glorify His praises, and after the prayers.) (50:39, 40) </p><p>This is why the Sunnah encouraged Tasbih (saying Subhan Allah, i.e., all praise is due to Allah), Tahmid (saying Al-Hamdu Lillah, i.e., all the thanks are due to Allah) and Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar, i.e., Allah is the Most Great) after the compulsory prayers. Ibn `Abbas said, \"We used to know that Allah's Messenger has finished the prayer by the Takbir.\" Similarly, several scholars have stated that reciting Takbir the during `Id-ul-Fitr was specified by the Ayah that states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِتُكْمِلُواْ الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ</div><p>((He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah i.e., to say Takbir (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great) for having guided you...) Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(...so that you may be grateful to Him.) means: If you adhere to what Allah commanded you, obeying Him by performing the obligations, abandoning the prohibitions and abiding by the set limits, then perhaps you will be among the grateful. </p>"

At that time, Muslims were allowed to eat, drink and have sexual intercourse only until the `Isha' (Night) prayer, unless one sleeps before the `Isha' prayer. Those who slept before `Isha' or offered the `Isha' prayer, were not allowed to drink, eat or sexual intervourse sex until the next night. The Muslims found that to be difficult for them. </p><p>The Ayat used the word `Rafath' to indicate sexual intercourse, according to Ibn `Abbas, `Ata' and Mujahid. Similar Tafsir was offered by Sa`id bin Jubayr, Tawus, Salim bin `Abdullah, `Amr bin Dinar, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri, Ad-Dahhak, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, As-Suddi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Muqatil bin Hayyan. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ</div><p>(They are Libas i.e., body-cover, or screen for you and you are Libas for them.) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that this Ayah means, \"Your wives are a resort for you and you for them.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"They are your cover and you are their cover.\" In short, the wife and the husband are intimate and have sexual intercourse with each other, and this is why they were permitted to have sexual activity during the nights of Ramadan, so that matters are made easier for them. </p><p>Abu Ishaq reported that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"When the Companions of Allah's Messenger observed fast but would sleep before breaking their fast, they would continue fasting until the following night. Qays bin Sirmah Al-Ansari was fasting one day and was working in his land. When the time to break the fast came, he went to his wife and said, `Do you have food' She said, `No. But I could try to get you some.' His eyes then were overcome by sleep and when his wife came back, she found him asleep. She said, `Woe unto you! Did you sleep' In the middle of the next day, he lost consciousness and mentioned what had happened to the Prophet . Then, this Ayah was revealed: r </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَآئِكُمْ</div><p>(It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting)) until... </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ</div><p>(and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall. ) Consequently, they were very delighted.\" Al-Bukhari reported this Hadith by Abu Ishaq who related that he heard Al-Bara' say, \"When fasting Ramadan was ordained, Muslims used to refrain from sleeping with their wives the entire month, but some men used to deceive themselves. Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ</div><p>(Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you.) </p><p>`Ali bin Abu Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"During the month of Ramadan, after Muslims would pray `Isha', they would not touch their women and food until the next night. Then some Muslims, including `Umar bin Al-Khattab, touched (had sex with) their wives and had some food during Ramadan after `Isha'. They complained to Allah's Messenger . Then Allah sent down: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلِمَ اللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ فَالـنَ بَـشِرُوهُنَّ</div><p>(Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them)\" This is the same narration that Al-`Awfi related from Ibn `Abbas. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَابْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ</div><p>(. ..and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring),) </p><p>Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, Anas, Shurayh Al-Qadi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata', Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, Hakam bin `Utbah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, and others said that this Ayah refers to having offspring. Qatadah said that the Ayah means, \"Seek the permission that Allah has allowed for you.\" Sa`id narrated that Qatadah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَابْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ</div><p>(and seek that which Allah has ordained for you,) </p><h2>Time for Suhur</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّيْلِ</div><p>(...and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall.) </p><p>Allah has allowed eating and drinking, along with having sexual intercourse, as we have stated, during any part of the night until the light of dawn is distinguished from the darkness of the night. Allah has described that time as `distinguishing the white thread from the black thread.' He then made it clearer when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنَ الْفَجْرِ</div><p>(of dawn.) </p><p>As stated in a Hadith that Imam Abu `Abdullah Al-Bukhari recorded, Sahl bin Sa`d said, \"When the following verse was revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الأَسْوَدِ</div><p>(Eat and drink until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the black thread) and (of dawn) was not revealed, some people who intended to fast, tied black and white threads to their legs and went on eating till they differentiated between the two. Allah then revealed the words, (of dawn), and it became clear to them that it meant (the darkness of) night and (the light of) day. \" </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said that `Adi said, \"I took two strings, one black and the other white and kept them under my pillow and went on looking at them throughout the night, but could not make any distinction between the two. So, the next morning I went to Allah's Messenger and told him the whole story. He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ وِسَادَكَ إِذًا لَعَرِيضٌ، أَنْ كَانَ الْخَيْطُ الْأَبْيَضُ وَالْأَسْوَدُ تَحْتَ وِسَادَتِك»</div><p>(Your pillow is very wide if the white and black threads are under it!) Some wordings for this Hadith read, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّكَ لَعَرِيضُ الْقَفَا»</div><p>(Your Qafa (back side of your neck) is wide!) </p><p>Some people said that these words meant that `Adi was not smart. This is a weak opinion. The narration that Al-Bukhari collected explains this part of the Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Adi bin Hatim narrated: I said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What is the white thread from the black thread Are they actual threads\" He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّكَ لَعَرِيضُ الْقَفَا أَنْ أَبْصَرْتَ الْخَيْطَيْنِ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: لَا بَلْ هُوَ سَوَادُ اللَّيْلِ وَبَيَاضُ النَّهَار»</div><p>(Your Qafa is wide if you see the two threads. Rather, they are the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the daylight.) </p><h2>Suhur is recommended</h2><p>Allah allowed eating and drinking until dawn, it represents proof that Suhur is encouraged, since it is a Rukhsah (concession or allowance) and Allah likes that the Rukhsah is accepted and implemented. The authentic Sunnah indicates that eating the Suhur is encouraged. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Anas narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«تَسَحَّرُوا فَإِنَّ فِي السَّحُورِ بَرَكَة»</div><p>(Eat the Suhur, for there is a blessing in Suhur.) </p><p>Muslim reported that `Amr bin Al-`As narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فَصْلَ مَا بَيْنَ صِيَامِنَا وصِيَامِ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ أَكْلَةُ السَّحَر»</div><p>(The distinction between our fast and the fast of the People of the Book is the meal of Suhur.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Sa`id narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«السَّحُورُ أَكْلُهُ بَرَكَةٌ فَلَا تَدَعُوهُ، وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ تَجْرَعُ جُرْعَةَ مَاءٍ، فَإِنَّ اللهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّون عَلَى الْمُتَسَحِّرِين»</div><p>(Suhur is a blessed meal. Hence, do not abandon it, even if one just takes a sip of water. Indeed, Allah and His angels send Salah (blessings) upon those who eat Suhur.) </p><p>There are several other Hadiths that encourage taking the Suhur, even if it only consists of a sip of water. </p><p>It is preferred that Suhur be delayed until the time of dawn. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Anas bin Malik narrated that Zayd bin Thabit said, \"We had Suhur with Allah's Messenger and then went on to pray.\" Anas asked, \"How much time was there between the Adhan (call to prayer) and the Suhur\" He said, \"The time that fifty Ayat take (to recite).\" </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Dharr saying that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَزَالُ أُمَّتِي بِخَيْرٍ مَا عَجَّلُوا الْإِفْطَارَ وَأَخَّرُوا السُّحُور»</div><p>(My Ummah will always retain goodness as long as they hasten in breaking the fast and delay the Suhur.) </p><p>There are several Hadiths that narrate that the Prophet called Suhur \"the blessed meal.\" </p><p>There are narrations from several of the Salaf that they allowed the Suhur to be eaten later until close to Fajr. This is is reported from Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Hudhayfah, Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and Zayd bin Thabit. It is also reported from many of the Tabi`in, such as Muhammad bin `Ali bin Husayn, Abu Mijlaz, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Abu Ad-Duha, Abu Wa'il and other companions of Ibn Mas`ud. This is also the opinion of `Ata', Al-Hasan, Hakam bin `Uyainah, Mujahid, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Abu Sha`tha' Jabir bin Zayd, Al- A`mash and Ma`mar bin Rashid. We have mentioned the chains of narrations for their statements in our (Ibn Kathir's) book about Siyam (Fasting), and all praise is due to Allah. </p><p>It is also recorded in the Two Sahihs that Al-Qasim said that `A'ishah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَمْنَعُكُمْ أَذَانُ بِلَالٍ عَنْ سَحُورِكُمْ، فَإِنَّهُ يُنَادِي بِلَيْلٍ، فَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّى تَسْمَعُوا أَذَانَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يُؤَذِّنُ حَتَّى يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْر»</div><p>(The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night. Hence, eat and drink until you hear the Adhan by Ibn Umm Maktum, for he does not call the Adhan until dawn.) </p><p>This is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Qays bin Talq quoted from his father that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ الْفَجْرُ الْمُسْتَطِيلَ فِي الْأُفُقِ وَلَكِنِ الْمُعْتَرِضُ الْأَحْمَر»</div><p>(Dawn is not the (ascending) glow of white light of the horizon. Rather, it is the red (radiating) light.) </p><p>Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, but their wording is: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُوا واشْرَبُوا، وَلَا يَهِيدَنَّكُمُ السَّاطِعُ الْمُصْعِدُ، فَكُلُوا واشْرَبُوا حَتَّى يَعْتَرِضَ لَكُمُ الْأَحْمَر»</div><p>(Eat and drink and do not be rushed by the ascending (white) light. Eat and drink until the redness (of the dawn) appears.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) recorded that Samurah bin Jundub narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ أَذَانُ بِلَالٍ وَلَا هَذَا الْبَيَاضُ لِعَمُودِ الصُّبْحِ حَتَّى يَسْتَطِير»</div><p>(Do not be stopped by Bilal's Adhan or the (ascending) whiteness, until it spreads.) Muslim also recorded this Hadith. </p><h2>Q: Is it \"Haram\" to begin fasting while \"Junub\"?</h2><p>Answer to: \"Is there harm in starting the month of fasting while junub?\" is: NO.</p><p>Issue: Among the benefits of allowing sexual activity, eating and drinking until dawn for those who are fasting, is that it is allowed to start the fast while Junub (in the state of impurity after sexual discharge), and there is no harm in this case if one takes a bath any time in the morning after waking up, and completes the fast. This is the opinion of the Four Imams and the majority of the scholars. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that `A'ishah and Umm Salamah said that Allah's Messenger used to wake up while Junub from sexual intercourse, not wet dreams, and he would take a bath and fast. Umm Salamah added that he would not break his fast or make up for that day. </p><p>Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said that a man asked: </p><p>يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ، تُدْرِكُنِي الصَّلَاةُ وَأَنَا جَنُبٌ فَأَصُومُ؟ فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَأَنَا تُدْرِكُنِي الصَّلاةُ وَأَنَا جُنُبٌ فَأَصُوم»</div><p>\"O Messenger of Allah! The (Dawn) prayer time starts while I am Junub, should I fast\" Allah's Messenger replied, (And I. The prayer time starts while I am Junub and I fast.) </p><p>He said, \"You are not like us, O Messenger of Allah! Allah has forgiven your previous and latter sins.\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَاللهِ إِنَّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَخْشَاكُمْ للهِ وَأَعْلَمَكُمْ بِمَا أَتَّقِي»</div><p>(By Allah! I hope that I have the most fear from Allah among you and the best knowledge of what Taqwa is.) </p><p>And Allah Knows Best</p><h2>Question: \"Does Fasting End Exactly at Sunset?\"</h2>Answer: Let us look to what Allah said: <div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّيْلِ</div><p>(...then complete your fast till the nightfall.) </p><p>This Ayah orders breaking the fast at sunset. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا أَقْبَلَ اللَّيْلُ مِنْ ههُنَا، وَأَدْبَرَ النَّهَارُ مِنْ ههُنَا فَقَدْ أَفْطَرَ الصَّائِم»</div><p>(If the night comes from this direction (the east), and the day departs from that direction (the west), then the fasting person breaks his fast.) </p><p>It is reported that Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا عَجَّلُوا الْفِطْر»</div><p>(The people will retain goodness as long as they hasten in breaking the fast.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: إِنَّ أَحَبَّ عِبَادِي إِلَيَّ أَعْجَلُهُمْ فِطْرًا»</div><p>(Allah the Exalted said, `The dearest among My servants to Me are those who hasten in breaking the fast the most.') </p><p>At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith and said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib. </p><h2>Prohibition of Uninterrupted Fasting (Wisal)</h2><p>There are several authentic Hadiths that prohibit Al-Wisal, which means continuing the fast through the night to the next night, without eating. Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُوَاصِلُوا»</div><p>قَالُوا: يَارَسُولَ اللهِ إِنَّكَ تُوَاصِلُ، قَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِّي لَسْتُ مِثْلَكُمْ إِنِّي أَبِيتُ يُطْعِمُنِي رَبِّي وَيَسْقِينِي»</div><p>(Do not practice Al-Wisal in fasting.) So, they said to him, \"But you practice Al-Wisal, O Allah's Messenger!\" The Prophet replied, \"(I am not like you, I am given food and drink during my sleep by my Lord.) ,So, when the people refused to stop Al-Wisal, the Prophet fasted two days and two nights (along with those who practiced Wisal) and then they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal). The Prophet said to them (angrily): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ تَأَخَّرَ الْهِلَالُ لَزِدْتُكُم»</div><p>(If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you fast for a longer period.) </p><p>That was as a punishment for them (when they refused to stop practicing Al-Wisal). This Hadith is also recorded in the Sahihayn. </p><p>The prohibition of Al-Wisal was also mentioned in a number of other narrations. It is a fact that practicing Al-Wisal was one of the special qualities of the Prophet , for he was capable and assisted in his practice of it. It is obvious that the food and drink that the Prophet used to get while practicing Al-Wisal was spiritual and not material, otherwise he would not be practicing Al-Wisal. We should mention that it is allowed to refrain from breaking the fast from sunset until before dawn (Suhur). A Hadith narrated by Abu Sa`id Khudri states that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُوَاصِلُوا فَأَيُّكُمْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُوَاصِلَ فَلْيُوَاصِلْ إِلَى السَّحَر»</div><p>(Do not practice Al-Wisal, but whoever wishes is allowed to practice it until the Suhur.) </p><p>They said, \"You practice Al-Wisal, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنِّي لَسْتُ كَهَيْئَتِكُمْ، إِنِّي أَبِيتُ لِي مُطْعِمٌ يُطْعِمُنِي وَسَاقٍ يَسْقِينِي»</div><p>(I am not similar to you, for I have One Who makes me eat and drink during the night.) This Hadith is also collected in the Two Sahihs. </p><h2>The Rulings of I`tikaf</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُبَـشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَـكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَـجِدِ</div><p>(And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I`tikaf in the Masjids.) </p><p>`Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This Ayah is about the man who stays in I`tikaf at the mosque during Ramadan or other months, Allah prohibited him from touching (having sexual intercourse with) women, during the night or day, until he finishes his I`tikaf.\" Ad-Dahhak said, \"Formerly, the man who practiced I`tikaf would go out of the mosque and, if he wished, would have sexual intercourse (with his wife). Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُبَـشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَـكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَـجِدِ</div><p>(And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I`tikaf in the Masjids.) meaning, `Do not touch your wives as long as you are in I`tikaf, whether you were in the mosque or outside of it'.\" It is also the opinion of Mujahid, Qatadah and several other scholars, that the Muslims used to have sexual intercourse with the wife while in I`tikaf if they departed the mosque until the Ayah was revealed. Ibn Abu Hatim commented, \"It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Mujahid, `Ata' Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Muqatil said that the Ayah means, `Do not touch the wife while in I`tikaf.\"' </p><p>What Ibn Abu Hatim reported from these people is the agreed upon practice among the scholars. Those who are in I`tikaf are not allowed to have sexual intercourse as long as they are still in I`tikaf in the mosque. If one has to leave the mosque to attend to a need, such as to relieve the call of nature or to eat, he is not allowed to kiss or embrace his wife or to busy himself with other than his I`tikaf. He is not even allowed to visit ailing persons, but he can merely ask about their condition while passing by. I`tikaf has several other rulings that are explained in the books (of Fiqh), and we have mentioned several of these rulings at the end of our book on Siyam (Fasting), all praise is due to Allah. Furthermore, the scholars of Fiqh used to follow their explanation of the rules for fasting with the explanation of the rules for I`tikaf, as this is the way these acts of worship were mentioned in the Qur'an. </p><p>By mentioning I`tikaf after fasting, Allah draws attention to practicing I`tikaf during the month of the fast, especially the last part of the month. The Sunnah of Allah's Messenger is that he used to perform I`tikaf during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan until he died. Afterwards, the Prophet's wives used to perform I`tikaf as the Two Sahihs recorded from `A'ishah the Mother of the believers. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Safiyyah, the daughter of Huyai, went to Allah's Messenger to visit him in the mosque while he was in I`tikaf. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her back home, as it was night. Her house was at Usamah bin Zayd's house on the edge of Al-Madinah. While they were walking, two Ansari men met them and passed by them in a hurry, for they were shy to bother the Prophet while he was walking with his wife. He told them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَلى رِسْلِكُمَا، إِنَّهَا صَفِيَّةُ بِنْتُ حُيَي»</div><p>(Do not run away! She is (my wife) Safiyyah bint Huyai.) Both of them said, \"All praise is due to Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah's Messenger!\" The Prophet said (to them): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ يَجْرِي مِنِ ابْنِ آدَمَ مَجْرَى الدَّمِ، وَإِنِّي خَشِيتُ أَنْ يَقْذِفَ فِي قُلُوبِكُمَا شَيْئًا، أَوْ قَالَ: شَرًّا»</div><p>(Shaytan reaches everywhere in the human body, that the blood reaches. I was afraid lest Shaytan might suggest an evil thought in your minds.) </p><p>Imam Ash-Shafi`i commented, \"Allah's Messenger sought to teach his Ummah to instantly eliminate any evil thought, so that they do not fall into the prohibited. They (the two Ansari men) had more fear of Allah than to think evil of the Prophet . Allah knows best.\" </p><p>The Ayah (2:187) prohibits sexual intercourse and anything like kissing or embracing that might lead to it during I`tikaf. As for having the wife helping the husband, it is allowed. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that `A'ishah said, \"Allah's Messenger would bring his head near me (in her room) and I would comb his hair, while I was on my menses. He would enter the room only to attend to what a man needs.\" </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(These are the limits (set) by Allah) means, `This is what We have explained, ordained, specified, allowed and prohibited for fasting. We also mentioned the fast's objectives, what is permitted during it, and what is required of it. These are the set limits that Allah has legislated and explained, so do not come near them or transgress them.' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"(Allah's set limits mentioned in the Ayah) mean these four limits (and he then recited): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَآئِكُمْ</div><p>(It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting).) and he recited up to: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ الصِّيَامَ إِلَى الَّيْلِ</div><p>(then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.) My father and other's used to say similarly and recite the same Ayah to us.\" </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ</div><p>(Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat to mankind) meaning, `Just as He explains the fast and its rulings, He also explains the other rulings by the words of His servant and Messenger, Muhammad .' Allah continues: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ</div><p>(to mankind that they may attain Taqwa.) meaning, `So that they know how to acquire the true guidance and how to worship (Allah).' Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant (Muhammad ) that He may bring you out from (types of) darkness into the light. And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) (57:9) </p>"

So he denies taking the loan and the case goes to the authorities, even though he knows that it is not his money and that he is a sinner, consuming what is not allowed for him.\" This opinion was also reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayan and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. They all stated, \"Do not dispute when you know that you are being unjust.\" </p><h2>The Judge's Ruling does not allow the Prohibited or prohibit the Lawful</h2><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Umm Salamah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا إِنَّمَا أَنَا بَشَرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا يَأْتِينِي الْخَصْمُ، فَلَعَلَّ بَعْضَكُمْ أَنْ يَكُونَ أَلْحَنَ بِحُجَّتِهِ مِنْ بَعْضٍ فَأَقْضِيَ لَهُ، فَمَنْ قَضَيْتُ لَهُ بِحَقِّ مُسْلِمٍ فَإِنَّمَا هِيَ قِطْعَةٌ مِنْ نَارٍ، فَلْيَحْمِلْهَا أَوْ لِيَذَرْهَا»</div><p>(I am only human!

So, if I give a Muslim's right to another, I am really giving him a piece of fire; so he should not take it.) </p><p>The Ayah and the Hadith prove that the judgment of the authorities in any case does not change the reality of the truth. Hence, the ruling does not allow what is in fact prohibited or prohibit what is in fact allowed. It is only applicable in that case. So if the ruling agrees with the truth, then there is no harm in this case.

The judge only rules according to his best judgment and according to the testimony of the witnesses. The judge is only human and is bound to make mistakes. Know that if the judge erroneously rules in some one's favor, then that person will still encounter the dispute when the disputing parties meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection. Then, the unjust person will be judged swiftly and precisely with that which will surpass whatever he acquired by the erroneous judgment he received in the life of this world.\" </p>"

Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9 in the Qur'an) was revealed.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ</div><p>(then kill them wherever you find them) (9:5). </p><p>However, this statement is not plausible, because Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ</div><p>(...those who fight you) applies only to fighting the enemies who are engaged in fighting Islam and its people. So the Ayah means, `Fight those who fight you', just as Allah said (in another Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاتِلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَآفَّةً كَمَا يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ كَآفَّةً</div><p>(...and fight against the Mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively.) (9:36) </p><p>This is why Allah said later in the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ</div><p>(And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.) meaning, `Your energy should be spent on fighting them, just as their energy is spent on fighting you, and on expelling them from the areas from which they have expelled you, as a law of equality in punishment.' </p><h2>The Prohibition of mutilating the Dead and stealing from the captured Goods</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَعْتَدُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ</div><p>(but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.) </p><p>This Ayah means, `Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions. Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that transgression (indicated by the Ayah), \"includes mutilating the dead, theft (from the captured goods), killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.\" This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Buraydah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْزُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، قَاتِلُوا مَنْ كَفَرَ بِاللهِ، اغْزُوا وَلَا تَغُلُّوا وَلَا تَغْدِرُوا وَلَا تَمْثُلُوا وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا وَلِيدًا وَلَا أَصْحَابَ الصَّوَامِع»</div><p>(Fight for the sake of Allah and fight those who disbelieve in Allah.

Abu Malik commented about what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) Meaning what you (disbelievers) are committing is much worse than killing.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) \"Shirk (polytheism) is worse than killing.\" </p><h2>Fighting in the Sacred Area is prohibited, except in Self-Defense</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُقَـتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the sanctuary at Makkah)) </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَمْ يَحِلَّ لِي إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ، وَإِنَّهَا سَاعَتِي هذِهِ حَرامٌ بحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيامَةِ، لا يُعْضَدُ شَجَرُهُ، وَلَا يُخْتَلىَ خَلَاهُ، فَإِنْ أَحَدٌ تَرَخَّصَ بِقِتَالِ رَسُولِ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم، فَقُولُوا: إنَّ اللهَ أَذِنَ لِرَسُولِهِ وَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لَكُم»</div><p>(Allah has made this city a sanctuary since the day He created the heavens and the earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was made legal for me only for an hour in the daytime. So, it (i.e., Makkah) is a sanctuary, by Allah's decree, from now on until the Day of Resurrection. Its trees should not be cut, and its grass should not be uprooted. If anyone mentions the fighting in it that occurred by Allah's Messenger, then say that Allah allowed His Messenger, but did not allow you.) </p><p>In this Hadith, Allah's Messenger mentions fighting the people of Makkah when he conquered it by force, leading to some deaths among the polytheists in the area of the Khandamah. This occurred after the Prophet proclaimed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَغْلَقَ بَابَهُ فهُوَ آمِنٌ،وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْمَسْجِدَ فَهُو آمِنٌ، ومَنْ دَخَلَ دَارَ أَبِي سُفْيَانَ فَهُوَ آمِن»</div><p>(Whoever closed his door is safe. Whoever entered the (Sacred) Mosque is safe. Whoever entered the house of Abu Sufyan is also safe.) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَـتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(...unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.) </p><p>Allah states: `Do not fight them in the area of the Sacred Mosque unless they start fighting you in it. In this case, you are allowed to fight them and kill them to stop their aggression.' Hence, Allah's Messenger took the pledge from his Companions under the tree (in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah) to fight (the polytheists), after the tribes of Quraysh and their allies, Thaqif and other groups, collaborated against the Muslims (to stop them from entering Makkah to visit the Sacred House). Then, Allah stopped the fighting before it started between them and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِن بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.) (48:24) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَآءٌ مُّؤْمِنَـتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَئُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكمْ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُواْ لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً</div><p>(Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills ـ if they (the believers and the disbelievers) had been apart, We verily, would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment.) (48:25) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنِ انتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(But if they cease, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) which means, `If they (polytheists) cease fighting you in the Sacred Area, and come to Islam and repent, then Allah will forgive them their sins, even if they had before killed Muslims in Allah's Sacred Area.' Indeed, Allah's forgiveness encompasses every sin, whatever its enormity, when the sinner repents it. </p><h2>The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</h2><p>Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(...until there is no more Fitnah) meaning, Shirk. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi`, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Zayd bin Aslam. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ للَّهِ</div><p>(...and the religion (all and every kind of worship) is for Allah (Alone).) means, `So that the religion of Allah becomes dominant above all other religions.' It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said: \"The Prophet was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah' The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَاتَلَ لِتَكُونَ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيا فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</div><p>(He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.) In addition, it is reported in the Two Sahihs: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَقُولُوا لَا إِلهَ إلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُم وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إلَّا بِحَقِّهَا وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى الله»</div><p>(I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people until they proclaim, `None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. Whoever said it, then he will save his life and property from me, except for cases of the law, and their account will be with Allah.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنِ انتَهَواْ فَلاَ عُدْوَنَ إِلاَّ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against the wrongdoers.) indicates that, `If they stop their Shirk and fighting the believers, then cease warfare against them. Whoever fights them afterwards will be committing an injustice. Verily aggression can only be started against the unjust.' This is the meaning of Mujahid's statement that only combatants should be fought. Or, the meaning of the Ayah indicates that, `If they abandon their injustice, which is Shirk in this case, then do not start aggression against them afterwards.' The aggression here means retaliating and fighting them, just as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(Then whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.) (2:194) </p><p>Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا</div><p>(The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof.) (42:40), and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُمْ بِهِ</div><p>(And if you punish them, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. ) (16:126) </p><p>`Ikrimah and Qatadah stated, \"The unjust person is he who refuses to proclaim, `There is no God worthy of worship except Allah'.\" </p><p>Under Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَـتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah) Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi` said that two men came to Ibn `Umar during the conflict of Ibn Az-Zubayr and said to him, \"The people have fallen into shortcomings and you are the son of `Umar and the Prophet's Companion. Hence, what prevents you from going out\" He said, \"What prevents me is that Allah has for bidden shedding the blood of my (Muslim) brother.\" They said, \"Did not Allah say: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَـتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah))\" He said, \"We did fight until there was no more Fitnah and the religion became for Allah Alone. You want to fight until there is Fitnah and the religion becomes for other than Allah!\" </p><p>`Uthman bin Salih added that a man came to Ibn `Umar and asked him, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What made you perform Hajj one year and `Umrah another year and abandon Jihad in the cause of Allah, although you know how much He has encouraged performing it\" He said, \"O my nephew! Islam is built on five (pillars): believing in Allah and His Messenger, the five daily prayers, fasting Ramadan, paying the Zakah and performing Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House.\" They said, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! Did you not hear what Allah said in His Book: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُواْ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَهُمَا فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الأُخْرَى فَقَـتِلُواْ الَّتِى تَبْغِى حَتَّى تَفِىءَ إِلَى أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And if two parties (or groups) among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah.) (49:9) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَـتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief)) </p><p>He said, \"That we did during the time of Allah's Messenger when Islam was still weak and (the Muslim) man used to face trials in his religion, such as killing or torture. When Islam became stronger (and apparent), there was no more Fitnah.\" He asked, \"What do you say about `Ali and `Uthman\" He said, \"As for `Uthman, Allah has forgiven him. However, you hated the fact that Allah had forgiven him! As for `Ali, he is the cousin of Allah's Messenger and his son-in-law.\" He then pointed with his hand, saying, \"This is where his house is located (meaning, `so close to the Prophet's house just as `Ali was so close to the Prophet himself').\" </p>"

Hence, Allah's Messenger took the pledge from his Companions under the tree (in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah) to fight (the polytheists), after the tribes of Quraysh and their allies, Thaqif and other groups, collaborated against the Muslims (to stop them from entering Makkah to visit the Sacred House).

Indeed, Allah's forgiveness encompasses every sin, whatever its enormity, when the sinner repents it. </p><h2>The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</h2><p>Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(...until there is no more Fitnah) meaning, Shirk.

It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said: \"The Prophet was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah' The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَاتَلَ لِتَكُونَ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيا فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</div><p>(He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.)

Whoever fights them afterwards will be committing an injustice. Verily aggression can only be started against the unjust.' This is the meaning of Mujahid's statement that only combatants should be fought. Or, the meaning of the Ayah indicates that, `If they abandon their injustice, which is Shirk in this case, then do not start aggression against them afterwards.' The aggression here means retaliating and fighting them, just as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(Then whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.)

Islam is built on five (pillars): believing in Allah and His Messenger, the five daily prayers, fasting Ramadan, paying the Zakah and performing Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House.\" They said, \"O Abu `Abdur-Rahman!

However, you hated the fact that Allah had forgiven him! As for `Ali, he is the cousin of Allah's Messenger and his son-in-law.\" He then pointed with his hand, saying, \"This is where his house is located (meaning, `so close to the Prophet's house just as `Ali was so close to the Prophet himself').\" </p>"

Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9 in the Qur'an) was revealed.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ</div><p>(then kill them wherever you find them) (9:5). </p><p>However, this statement is not plausible, because Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ</div><p>(...those who fight you) applies only to fighting the enemies who are engaged in fighting Islam and its people. So the Ayah means, `Fight those who fight you', just as Allah said (in another Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاتِلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَآفَّةً كَمَا يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ كَآفَّةً</div><p>(...and fight against the Mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively.)

Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.) </p><p>This Ayah means, `Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions. Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that transgression (indicated by the Ayah), \"includes mutilating the dead, theft (from the captured goods), killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.\" This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Buraydah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْزُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، قَاتِلُوا مَنْ كَفَرَ بِاللهِ، اغْزُوا وَلَا تَغُلُّوا وَلَا تَغْدِرُوا وَلَا تَمْثُلُوا وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا وَلِيدًا وَلَا أَصْحَابَ الصَّوَامِع»</div><p>(Fight for the sake of Allah and fight those who disbelieve in Allah.

Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9 in the Qur'an) was revealed.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقْتُلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ</div><p>(then kill them wherever you find them) (9:5). </p><p>However, this statement is not plausible, because Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ</div><p>(...those who fight you) applies only to fighting the enemies who are engaged in fighting Islam and its people. So the Ayah means, `Fight those who fight you', just as Allah said (in another Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَاتِلُواْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَآفَّةً كَمَا يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ كَآفَّةً</div><p>(...and fight against the Mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively.) (9:36) </p><p>This is why Allah said later in the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ</div><p>(And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.) meaning, `Your energy should be spent on fighting them, just as their energy is spent on fighting you, and on expelling them from the areas from which they have expelled you, as a law of equality in punishment.' </p><h2>The Prohibition of mutilating the Dead and stealing from the captured Goods</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَعْتَدُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ</div><p>(but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.) </p><p>This Ayah means, `Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions. Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that transgression (indicated by the Ayah), \"includes mutilating the dead, theft (from the captured goods), killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.\" This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Buraydah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اغْزُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، قَاتِلُوا مَنْ كَفَرَ بِاللهِ، اغْزُوا وَلَا تَغُلُّوا وَلَا تَغْدِرُوا وَلَا تَمْثُلُوا وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا وَلِيدًا وَلَا أَصْحَابَ الصَّوَامِع»</div><p>(Fight for the sake of Allah and fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Fight, but do not steal (from the captured goods), commit treachery, mutilate (the dead), or kill a child, or those who reside in houses of worship.) </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Umar said, \"A woman was found dead during one of the Prophet's battles and the Prophet then forbade killing women and children. \" There are many other Hadiths on this subject. </p><h2>Shirk is worse than Killing</h2><p>Since Jihad involves killing and shedding the blood of men, Allah indicated that these men are committing disbelief in Allah, associating with Him (in the worship) and hindering from His path, and this is a much greater evil and more disastrous than killing. Abu Malik commented about what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) Meaning what you (disbelievers) are committing is much worse than killing.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) \"Shirk (polytheism) is worse than killing.\" </p><h2>Fighting in the Sacred Area is prohibited, except in Self-Defense</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُقَـتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the sanctuary at Makkah)) </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَمْ يَحِلَّ لِي إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ، وَإِنَّهَا سَاعَتِي هذِهِ حَرامٌ بحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيامَةِ، لا يُعْضَدُ شَجَرُهُ، وَلَا يُخْتَلىَ خَلَاهُ، فَإِنْ أَحَدٌ تَرَخَّصَ بِقِتَالِ رَسُولِ اللهِصلى الله عليه وسلّم، فَقُولُوا: إنَّ اللهَ أَذِنَ لِرَسُولِهِ وَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لَكُم»</div><p>(Allah has made this city a sanctuary since the day He created the heavens and the earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was made legal for me only for an hour in the daytime. So, it (i.e., Makkah) is a sanctuary, by Allah's decree, from now on until the Day of Resurrection. Its trees should not be cut, and its grass should not be uprooted. If anyone mentions the fighting in it that occurred by Allah's Messenger, then say that Allah allowed His Messenger, but did not allow you.) </p><p>In this Hadith, Allah's Messenger mentions fighting the people of Makkah when he conquered it by force, leading to some deaths among the polytheists in the area of the Khandamah. This occurred after the Prophet proclaimed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ أَغْلَقَ بَابَهُ فهُوَ آمِنٌ،وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْمَسْجِدَ فَهُو آمِنٌ، ومَنْ دَخَلَ دَارَ أَبِي سُفْيَانَ فَهُوَ آمِن»</div><p>(Whoever closed his door is safe. Whoever entered the (Sacred) Mosque is safe. Whoever entered the house of Abu Sufyan is also safe.) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يُقَـتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَـتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(...unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.) </p><p>Allah states: `Do not fight them in the area of the Sacred Mosque unless they start fighting you in it. In this case, you are allowed to fight them and kill them to stop their aggression.' Hence, Allah's Messenger took the pledge from his Companions under the tree (in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah) to fight (the polytheists), after the tribes of Quraysh and their allies, Thaqif and other groups, collaborated against the Muslims (to stop them from entering Makkah to visit the Sacred House). Then, Allah stopped the fighting before it started between them and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِن بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.) (48:24) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْلاَ رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَآءٌ مُّؤْمِنَـتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَئُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكمْ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُواْ لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً</div><p>(Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills ـ if they (the believers and the disbelievers) had been apart, We verily, would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment.) (48:25) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنِ انتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(But if they cease, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) which means, `If they (polytheists) cease fighting you in the Sacred Area, and come to Islam and repent, then Allah will forgive them their sins, even if they had before killed Muslims in Allah's Sacred Area.' Indeed, Allah's forgiveness encompasses every sin, whatever its enormity, when the sinner repents it. </p><h2>The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</h2><p>Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(...until there is no more Fitnah) meaning, Shirk. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi`, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Zayd bin Aslam. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ للَّهِ</div><p>(...and the religion (all and every kind of worship) is for Allah (Alone).) means, `So that the religion of Allah becomes dominant above all other religions.' It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said: \"The Prophet was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah' The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ قَاتَلَ لِتَكُونَ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيا فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</div><p>(He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.) In addition, it is reported in the Two Sahihs: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَقُولُوا لَا إِلهَ إلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُم وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إلَّا بِحَقِّهَا وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى الله»</div><p>(I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people until they proclaim, `None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. Whoever said it, then he will save his life and property from me, except for cases of the law, and their account will be with Allah.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنِ انتَهَواْ فَلاَ عُدْوَنَ إِلاَّ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against the wrongdoers.) indicates that, `If they stop their Shirk and fighting the believers, then cease warfare against them. Whoever fights them afterwards will be committing an injustice. Verily aggression can only be started against the unjust.' This is the meaning of Mujahid's statement that only combatants should be fought. Or, the meaning of the Ayah indicates that, `If they abandon their injustice, which is Shirk in this case, then do not start aggression against them afterwards.' The aggression here means retaliating and fighting them, just as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(Then whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.) (2:194) </p><p>Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا</div><p>(The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof.) (42:40), and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُمْ بِهِ</div><p>(And if you punish them, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. ) (16:126) </p><p>`Ikrimah and Qatadah stated, \"The unjust person is he who refuses to proclaim, `There is no God worthy of worship except Allah'.\" </p><p>Under Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَـتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</div><p>(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah) Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi` said that two men came to Ibn `Umar during the conflict of Ibn Az-Zubayr and said to him, \"The people have fallen into shortcomings and you are the son of `Umar and the Prophet's Companion.

Then, the idolators prevented him from entering the Sacred House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) along with the Muslims who came with him. This incident occurred during the sacred month of Dhul-Qa`dah. The idolators agreed to allow them to enter the House the next year. Hence, the Prophet entered the House the following year, along with the Muslims who accompanied him, and Allah permitted him to avenge the idolators' treatment of him, when He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الشَّهْرُ الْحَرَامُ بِالشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْحُرُمَـتُ قِصَاصٌ</div><p>(The sacred month is for the sacred month, and for the prohibited things, there is the Law of equality (Qisas).) </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"Allah's Messenger would not engage in warfare during the Sacred Month unless he was first attacked, then he would march forth.

They were one thousand and four hundred then. When the Prophet was informed that `Uthman was not killed, he abandoned the fight and reverted to peace. </p><p>When the Prophet finished fighting with (the tribes of) Hawazin during the battle of Hunayn and Hawazin took refuge in (the city of) At-Ta'if, he laid siege to that city. Then, the (sacred) month of Dhul-Qa`dah started, while At-Ta'if was still under siege. The siege went on for the rest of the forty days (rather, from the day the battle of Hunayn started until the Prophet went back to Al-Madinah from Al-Ji`ranah, were forty days), as reported in the Two Sahihs and narrated by Anas. When the Companions suffered mounting casualties (during the siege), the Prophet ended the siege before conquering At-Ta'if. He then went back to Makkah, performed `Umrah from Al-Ji`ranah, where he divided the war booty of Hunayn. This `Umrah occurred during Dhul-Qa`dah of the eighth year of Al-Hijrah. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(...whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.) ordains justice even with the polytheists.

(4:84) That Ayah (2:195) is about (refraining from) spending.\" Ibn Marduwyah reported this Hadith, as well as Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak who said; \"It meets the criteria of the Two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) but they did not record it.\" Ath-Thawri and Qays bin Ar-Rabi` related it from Al-Bara'. but added: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تُكَلَّفُ إِلاَّ نَفْسَكَ</div><p>(You are not tasked (held responsible) except for yourself.) (4:84) \"Destruction refers to the man who sins and refrains from repenting, thus throwing himself to destruction.\" </p><p>Ibn `Abbas said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلاَ تُلْقُواْ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ</div><p>(And spend in the cause of Allah and do not throw yourselves into destruction) \"This is not about fighting. But about refraining from spending for the sake of Allah, in which case, one will be throwing his self into destruction.\" </p><p>The Ayah (2:195) includes the order to spend in Allah's cause, in the various areas and ways that involve obedience and drawing closer to Allah. It especially applies to spending in fighting the enemies and on what strengthens the Muslims against the enemy. Allah states that those who refrain from spending in this regard will face utter and certain demise and destruction, meaning those who acquire this habit. Allah commands that one should acquire Ihsan (excellence in the religion), as it is the highest part of the acts of obedience. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَحْسِنُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</div><p>(and do good. Truly, Allah loves Al-Muhsinin (those who do good).) </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Command to complete Hajj and `Umrah</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the rulings for fasting and Jihad, he explained the rituals by commanding the Muslims to complete Hajj and `Umrah, meaning, to finish the rituals of Hajj and `Umrah after one starts them. This is why Allah said afterwards: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ</div><p>(But if you are prevented) meaning, if your way to the House is obstructed, and you are prevented from finishing it. This is why the scholars agree that starting the acts of Hajj and `Umrah requires one to finish them. As for Makhul, he said, \"Complete, means to start them from the Miqat (areas the Prophet designated to assume Ihram from).\" `Abdur-Razzaq said that Az-Zuhri said: \"We were told that `Umar commented on: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And complete Hajj and `Umrah for Allah.) \"Complete Hajj and `Umrah means performing each of them separately, and to perform `Umrah outside of the months of Hajj, for Allah the Exalted says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَـتٌ</div><p>(The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months. )\" </p><p>As-Suddi said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And complete Hajj and `Umrah for Allah.) means, \"Maintain the performance of Hajj and `Umrah.\" Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said, \"Hajj is `Arafat, while `Umrah is Tawaf.\" Al-A`mash related that Ibrahim said that `Alqamah commented on Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And complete Hajj and `Umrah for Allah.) \"Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) recited it this way: `Complete Hajj and `Umrah to the House, so that one does not exceed the area of the House during the `Umrah'.\" Ibrahim then said, \"I mentioned this statement to Sa`id bin Jubayr and he said; `Ibn `Abbas also said that.\"' Sufyan reported that Ibrahim said that `Alqamah said (regarding the Ayah 2:196), \"Perform the Hajj and `Umrah to the House.\" Ath-Thawri reported that Ibrahim read (the Ayah), \"Perform the Hajj and `Umrah to the House.\" </p><h2>If One is prevented while in Route, He slaughters the Sacrifice, shaves his Head and ends Ihram</h2><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(But if you are prevented, sacrifice a Hady (animals for sacriface) such as you can afford,) was revealed in the sixth year of Hijrah, the year of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the polytheists prevented Allah's Messenger from reaching the House. Allah revealed Surat Al-Fath (chapter 48 in the Qur'an) then, and allowed the Muslims to slaughter any Hady (animals for sacrifice) they had. They had seventy camels with them for that purpose. They were also permitted to shave their heads and end their Ihram. When the Prophet commanded them to shave their heads and end the state of Ihram, they did not obey him, as they were awaiting that order to be abrogated. When they saw that the Prophet went out after shaving his head, they imitated him. Some of them did not shave, but only shortened their hair. This is why the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَحِمَ اللهُ الْمُحَلِّقِين»</div><p>(May Allah award His mercy to those who shaved.) </p><p>They said, \"What about those who shortened the hair\" He said in the third time, \"And to those who shortened.\" Every seven among them shared one camel for their sacrifice. They were one thousand and four hundred Companions and were camping in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah, outside the Sacred Area. It was also reported that they were within the boundaries of the Sacred Area. Allah knows best. </p><p>Being prevented from the House (Hasr) includes more than just being sick, fearing an enemy or getting lost on the way to Makkah. Imam Ahmad reported that Al-Hajjaj bin `Amr Al-Ansari said that he heard Allah's Messenger saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ كُسِرَ أَوْ عَرِجَ فَقَدْ حَلَّ وَعَلَيْهِ حَجَّةٌ أُخْرَى»</div><p>(Whoever suffered a broken bone or a limb, will have ended his Ihram and has to perform Hajj again.) He said, \"I mentioned that to Ibn `Abbas and Abu Hurayrah and they both said, `He (Al-Hajjaj) has said the truth'.\" This Hadith is also reported in the Four Collections. In the version of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah, the Prophet said, \"Whoever limped, had a broken bone or became ill...\" Ibn Abu Hatim also recorded it and said, \"It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn Az-Zubayr, `Alqamah, Sa`id bin Musayyib, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Mujahid, An-Nakha`i, `Ata' and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that being prevented (Hasr) entails an enemy, an illness or a fracture.\" Ath-Thawri also said, \"Being prevented entails everything that harms the person.\" </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger went to Duba`ah bint Az-Zubayr bin `Abdul-Muttalib who said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I intend to perform Hajj but I am ill.\" He said, \"Perform Hajj and make the condition: `My place is where You prevent (or halt) me.\" Muslim recorded similarly from Ibn `Abbas. So saying such a condition for Hajj is allowed is based on this Hadith. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(...sacrifice a Hady such as you can afford) includes a sheep also, as Imam Malik reported that `Ali bin Abu Talib used to say. Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Hady includes eight types of animals: camels, cows, goats and sheep.\" `Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said about what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(...sacrifice a Hady such as you can afford) </p><p>\"As much as one could afford.\" Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If one can afford it, then camels, otherwise cows, or sheep.\" Hisham bin `Urwah quoted his father: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(...sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e., a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford) `Depending on the price.' </p><p>The proof that sacrificing only a sheep is allowed in the case of being prevented from continuing the rites, is that Allah has required sacrificing whatever is available as a Hady, and the Hady is any type of cattle; be it camels, cows or sheep. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas the cousin of Allah's Messenger and the scholar of Tafsir. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that `A'ishah, the Mother of the believers, said, \"The Prophet once offered some sheep as Hady.\" </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَحْلِقُواْ رُءُوسَكُمْ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْىُ مَحِلَّهُ</div><p>(...and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice.) is a continuation of His statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَتِمُّواْ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And complete, the Hajj and `Umrah for Allah.) and is not dependent upon: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(But if you are prevented, then sacrifice a Hady) as Ibn Jarir has erroneously claimed. When the Prophet and his Companions were prevented from entering the Sacred House during the Al-Hudaybiyyah year by the polytheists from Quraysh, they shaved their heads and sacrificed their Hady outside the Haram (Sacred) area. In normal circumstances, and when one can safely reach the House, he is not allowed to shave his head until: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْهَدْىُ مَحِلَّهُ</div><p>(.. .and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice.) and then he ends the rituals of Hajj or `Umrah, or both if he had assumed Ihram for both. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Hafsah said, \"O Allah's Messenger! What is wrong with the people, they have finished their Ihram for `Umrah but you have not\" The Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنِّي لَبَّدْتُ رَأْسِي وَقَلَّدْتُ هَدْيِي، فَلَا أَحِلُّ حَتَّى أَنْحَر»</div><p>(I matted my hair and I have garlanded my Hady (animals for sacrifice), so I will not finish my Ihram till I offer the sacrifice.) </p><h2>Whoever shaved his Head during Ihram, will have to pay the Fidyah</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ</div><p>(And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment on his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah.) </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that `Abdur-Rahman bin Asbahani said that he heard `Abdullah bin Ma`qil saying that he sat with Ka`b bin `Ujrah in the mosque of Kufah (in Iraq). He then asked him about the Fidyah of the fasting. Ka`b said, \"This was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah's Messenger and the lice were falling in great numbers on my face. The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا كُنْتُ أُرَى أَنَّ الْجَهْدَ بلَغَ بكَ هذَا، أمَا تَجِدُ شَاة»</div><p>؟ قُلْتُ: لَا </p><p>(I never thought that your ailment (or struggle) had reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep (for sacrifice)' I replied in the negative.) He then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ أَوْ أَطْعِمْ سِتَّةَ مَسَاكِينَ، لِكُلِّ مِسْكِينٍ نِصْفُ صَاعٍ مِنْ طَعَامٍ، وَاحْلِقْ رَأْسَك»</div><p>(Fast for three days or feed six poor persons, each with half a Sa` of food (1 Sa` = 3 kilograms approx.) and shave your head.) </p><p>So this is a general judgement derived from a specific case. </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin `Ujrah said, \"Allah's Messenger came by while I was igniting the fire under a pot and while the lice were falling down my head or my eyelids. He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُؤْذِيكَ هَوَامُّ رَأْسِك»</div><p>؟ قُلْتُ: نَعَمْ </p><p>(Do these lice in your head bother you) I said, `Yes.' He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَاحْلِقْهُ، وَصُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ، أَوْ أَطْعِمْ سِتَّةَ مَسَاكِينَ، أَوِ انْسُكْ نَسِيكَة»</div><p>(Shave it, then fast three days, or feed six poor people, or sacrifice an animal.) </p><p>Ayyub (one of the narrators of the Hadith) commented, \"I do not know which alternative was stated first.\" The wording of the Qur'an begins with the easiest then the more difficult options: \"Pay a Fidyah of fasting (three days), feeding (six poor persons) or sacrificing (an animal).\" Meanwhile, the Prophet advised Ka`b with the more rewarding option first, that is, sacrificing a sheep, then feeding six poor persons, then fasting three days. Each Text is suitable in its place and context, all the thanks and praises are due to Allah. </p><h2>Tamattu` during Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the `Umrah (in the months of Hajj), before (performing) the Hajj, he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford,) </p><p>That is, when you are able to complete the rites, so whoever among you connects his `Umrah with Hajj having the same Ihram for both, or, first assuming Ihram for `Umrah, and then assuming Ihram for Hajj when finished the `Umrah, this is the more specific type of Tamattu` which is well-known among the discussion of the scholars whereas in general there are two types of Tamattu`, as the authentic Hadiths prove, since among the narrators are those who said, \"Allah's Messenger performed Tamattu`, and others who said, \"Qarin\" but there is no difference between them over the Hady. </p><p>So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the `Umrah (in the months of Hajj), before (performing) the Hajj (i.e., Hajj At-Tamattu` and Al-Qiran), he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford,) means let him sacrifice whatever Hady is available to him, the least of which is a sheep. One is also allowed to sacrifice a cow because the Prophet slaughtered cows on behalf of his wives. Al-Awza`i reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger slaughtered cows on behalf of his wives when they were performing Tamattu`. This was reported by Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah. </p><p>This last Hadith proves that Tamattu` is legislated. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that `Imran bin Husayn said, \"We performed Hajj At-Tamattu` in the lifetime of Allah's Messenger and then the Qur'an was revealed (regarding Hajj At-Tamattu`). Nothing was revealed to forbid it, nor did he (the Prophet ) forbid it until he died. And somebody said what he wished (regarding Hajj At-Tamattu`) according to his own opinion.\" Al-Bukhari said that `Imran was talking about `Umar. It is reported in an authentic narration that `Umar used to discourage the people from performing Tamattu`. He used to say, \"If we refer to Allah's Book, we should complete it,\" meaning: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْىِ</div><p>(...whosoever performs the `Umrah (in the months of Hajj), before (performing) the Hajj, he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford,) </p><p>However `Umar did not say that Tamattu` is unlawful. He only prevented them so that the people would increase their trips to the House for Hajj (during the months of Hajj) and `Umrah (throughout the year), as he himself has stated. </p><h2>Whoever performs Tamattu` should fast Ten Days if He does not have a Hady</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَـثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ</div><p>(...but if he cannot (afford it), he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home), making ten days in all.) </p><p>This Ayah means: \"Those who do not find a Hady, let them fast three days during the Hajj season.\" Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If one does not have a Hady, he should fast three days during Hajj, before `Arafah day. If the day of `Arafah was the third day, then his fast is complete. He should also fast seven days when he gets back home.\" Abu Ishaq reported from Wabarah from Ibn `Umar who said, \"One fasts one day before the day of Tarwiyah, the day of Tarwiyah (eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah) and then `Arafah day (the ninth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah).\" The same statement was reported by Ja`far bin Muhammad from his father from `Ali. </p><p>If one did not fast these three days or at least some of them before `Id day (the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah), he is allowed to fast during the Tashriq days (11-12-13th day of Dhul-Hijjah). `A'ishah and Ibn `Umar said, \"Fasting the days of Tashriq was only allowed for those who did not find the Hady,\" as Al-Bukhari has reported. Sufyan related that Ja`far bin Muhammad narrated that his father said that `Ali said, \"Whoever did not fast the three days during the Hajj, should fast them during the days of Tashriq.\" This is also the position taken by `Ubayd bin `Umayr Al-Laythi, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, referring to the general meaning of Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَصِيَامُ ثَلَـثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ</div><p>(...fast three days during the Hajj...) </p><p>As for what Muslim reported that Qutaybah Al-Hudhali said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وَشُرْبٍ، وَذِكْرِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»</div><p>(The days of Tashriq are days of eating and drinking and remembering Allah the Exalted.) </p><p>This narration is general in meaning while what `A'ishah and Ibn `Umar narrated is specific. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ</div><p>(...and seven days after his return.) </p><p>There are two opinions regarding the meaning of this Ayah. First, it means `when you return to the camping areas'. The second, upon going back home. `Abdur-Razzaq reported that Salim narrated that he heard Ibn `Umar saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَـثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ</div><p>\"(...but if he cannot (afford it), he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return,) means when he goes back to his family. \" The same opinion was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, `Ata', `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Imam Az-Zuhri and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Salim bin `Abdullah narrated that Ibn `Umar said, \"During the Farewell Hajj of Allah's Messenger , he performed Tamattu` with `Umrah and Hajj. He drove a Hady along with him from Dhul-Hulayfah. Allah's Messenger started by assuming Ihram for `Umrah, and then for Hajj. And the people, too, performed the `Umrah and Hajj along with the Prophet . Some of them brought the Hady and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Makkah, he said to the people: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ كَانَ مِنْكُم أَهْدَى فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَحِلُّ مِنْ شَيْءٍ حَرُمَ مِنْهُ حَتَّى يَقْضِيَ حَجَّهُ، وَمَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أَهْدَى فَلْيَطُفْ بالْبَيْتِ وبالصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةِ وَلْيُقَصِّرْ وَلْيَحْلِلْ، ثُمَّ لْيُهِلَّ بِالْحَجِّ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يجَدْ هَدْيًا فَلْيَصُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ فِي الْحَجِّ، وَسَبْعةً إِذَا رَجَعَ إِلى أَهْلِه»</div><p>(Whoever among you has driven the Hady, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hady with him, he should perform Tawaf of the Ka`bah and between As-Safa and Al-Marwah. Then, he should shave or cut his hair short and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hady (sacrifice). And if anyone cannot afford a Hady, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home.) </p><p>He then mentioned the rest of the Hadith, which is reported in the Two Sahihs. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ</div><p>(...making ten days in all.) to emphasize the ruling we mentioned above. This method is common in the Arabic language, for they would say, `I have seen with my eyes, heard with my ears and written with my hand,' to emphasize such facts. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ</div><p>(...nor a bird that flies with its two wings) (6:38) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَخُطُّهُ بِيَمِينِكَ</div><p>(...nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand) (29:48) and: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَعَدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلَـثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَـتُ رَبِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً</div><p>(And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added (to the period) ten (more), and he completed the term, appointed by his Lord, of forty nights.) (7:142) </p><p>It was also said that the meaning of \"ten days in all\" emphasizes the order to fast for ten days, not less than that. </p><h2>The Residents of Makkah do not perform Tamattu</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِى الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(This is for him whose family is not present at Al-Masjid Al-Haram (i.e., non-resident of Makkah).) This Ayah concerns the residents of the area of the Haram, for they do not perform Tamattu`. `Abdur-Razzaq reported that Tawus said, \"Tamattu` is for the people, those whose families are not residing in the Haram area (Makkah), not for the residents of Makkah. Hence Allah's Statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِى الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(This is for him whose family is not present at Al-Masjid Al-Haram (i.e., non-resident of Makkah).) </p><p>`Abdur-Razzaq then said, \"I was also told that Ibn `Abbas said similar to Tawus.\" Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(...and fear Allah) meaning, in what He has commanded you and what He prohibited for you. He then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</div><p>(...and know that Allah is severe in punishment) for those who defy His command and commit what He has prohibited. </p>"

This was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Jabir, `Ata', Tawus and Mujahid. The proof for this is Allah's statement that Hajj occurs during known, specific months, which indicates that Hajj is not allowed before that, just as the prayer has a fixed time (before which one's prayer is not accepted). </p><p>Ash-Shafi`i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"No person should assume Ihram for Hajj before the months of the Hajj, for Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَـتٌ</div><p>(The Hajj is (in) the well-known months.) </p><p>Ibn Khuzaymah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"No Ihram for Hajj should be assumed, except during the months of Hajj, for among the Sunnah of Hajj is that one assume Ihram for it during the Hajj months. \" This is an authentic narration and the Companion's statement that such and such is among the Sunnah is considered as a Hadith of the Prophet , according to the majority of the scholars. This is especially the case when it is Ibn `Abbas who issued this statement, as he is the Tarjuman (translator, interpreter, explainer) of the Qur'an. </p><p>There is a Hadith about this subject too. Ibn Marduwyah related that Jabir narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَنْبَغِي لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يُحْرِمَ بِالْحَجِّ إِلَّا فِي أَشْهُرِ الْحَج»</div><p>(No one should assume Ihram for Hajj, but during the months of Hajj.) </p><p>The chain of narrators for this Hadith is reasonable. Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Bayhaqi recorded this Hadith from Ibn Jurayj who related that Abu Az-Zubayr said that he heard Jabir bin `Abdullah being asked, \"Does one assume Ihram for Hajj before the months of the Hajj\" He said, \"No.\" This narration is more reliable than the narration that we mentioned from the Prophet . In short, this statement is the opinion of the Companion, supported by Ibn `Abbas' statement that it is a part of the Sunnah not to assume Ihram for Hajj before the months of the Hajj. Allah knows best. </p><h2>The Months of Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَـتٌ</div><p>(...the well-known months.) </p><p>Al-Bukhari said that Ibn `Umar said that these are Shawwal, Dhul-Qa`dah and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. This narration for which Al-Bukhari did not mention the chain of narrators, was collected by a continuous chain of narrators that Ibn Jarir rendered authentic, leading to Ibn `Umar, who said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَـتٌ</div><p>(The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months.) \"which are Shawwal, Dhul-Qa`dah and the (first) ten days of Dhul-Hijjah.\" Its chain is Sahih. Al-Hakim also recorded it in his Mustadrak, and he said,\"It meets the criteria of the Two Shaykhs.\" </p><p>This statement is also reported from `Umar, `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, Ibn `Abbas, `Ata', Tawus, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Imam Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Makhul, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Muqatil bin Hayyan. This opinion was preferred by Ibn Jarir who said, \"It is a common practice to call two months and a part of the third month as `months'. This is similar to the Arab's saying, `I visited such and such person this year or this day.' He only visited him during a part of the year and a part of the day. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him.) </p><p>In this case, one will only be hastening for one and a half days.\" </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ</div><p>(So whosoever intends (Farada) to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram),) meaning that one's assuming the Ihram requires a Hajj, for the person is required to complete the rituals of Hajj after assuming Ihram. Ibn Jarir said that Al-`Awfi said, \"The scholars agree that (Farada) `intends' mentioned in the Ayah means it is a requirement and an obligation.\" `Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said: f </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ</div><p>(So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), ) refers to those who assume Ihram for Hajj and `Umrah\". `Ata' said, \"'Intends', means, assumes the Ihram.\" Similar statements were attributed to Ibrahim, Ad-Dahhak and others. </p><h2>Prohibition of Rafath (Sexual Intercourse) during Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ رَفَثَ</div><p>(He should not have Rafath) </p><p>This Ayah means that those who assume the Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah are required to avoid the Rafath, meaning, sexual intercourse. Allah's statement here is similar to His statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَآئِكُمْ</div><p>(It is made lawful for you to have Rafath (sexual relations) with your wives on the night of the fast.) (2:187) </p><p>Whatever might lead to sexual intercourse, such as embracing, kissing and talking to women about similar subjects, is not allowed. Ibn Jarir reported that Nafi` narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"Rafath means sexual intercourse or mentioning this subject with the tongue, by either men or women.\" `Ata' bin Abu Rabah said that Rafath means sexual intercourse and foul speech. This is also the opinion of `Amr bin Dinar. `Ata' also said that they used to even prevent talking (or hinting) about this subject. Tawus said that Rafath includes one's saying, \"When I end the Ihram I will have sex with you.\" This is also the same explanation offered by Abu Al-`Aliyah regarding Rafath. `Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Rafath means having sex with the wife, kissing, fondling and saying foul words to her, and similar acts.\" Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar said that Rafath means to have sex with women. This is also the opinion of Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Abu Al-`Aliyah who narrated it from `Ata' and Makhul, `Ata Al-Khurasani, `Ata' bin Yasar, `Atiyah, Ibrahim, Ar-Rabi`, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Malik bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, `Abdul-Karim bin Malik, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak, and others. </p><h2>The Prohibition of Fusuq during Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ فُسُوقَ</div><p>(...nor commit sin) Miqsam and several other scholars related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is disobedience.\" This is also the opinion of `Ata,' Mujahid, Tawus, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Ata' bin Yasar, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Muqatil bin Hayyan. </p><p>Ibn Wahb reported that Nafi` narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"Fusuq or sin mentioned in the Ayah (2:197) refers to committing what Allah has forbidden in the Sacred Area.\" </p><p>Several others said that Fusuq means cursing others, they based this on the authentic Hadith: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سِبَابُ الْمُسْلِمِ فُسُوقٌ وَقِتَالُهُ كُفْر»</div><p>(Cursing the Muslim is Fusuq, while fighting him is Kufr.) </p><p>`Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said Fusuq here means slaughtering animals for the idols, as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ فِسْقًا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ</div><p>(...or impious (Fisq) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah.) (6: 145) </p><p>Ad-Dahhak said that Fusuq is insulting one another with bad nicknames. </p><p>Those who said that the Fusuq means all types of disobedience are correct. Allah has also prohibited committing injustice during the months of Hajj in specific, although injustice is prohibited throughout the year. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْهَآ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ذلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ فَلاَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ</div><p>(...of them four are sacred. That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein.) (9:36) </p><p>Allah said about the Sacred Area: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</div><p>(...and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.) (22:25) </p><p>It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ حَجَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتَ، فَلَمْ يَرْفُثْ وَلَمْ يَفْسُقْ خَرَجَ مِنْ ذُنُوبِهِ كَيَوْمَ وَلَدَتْهُ أُمُّه»</div><p>(Whoever performed Hajj to this (Sacred) House and did not commit Rafath or Fusuq, will return sinless, just as the day his mother gave birth to him.) </p><h2>The Prohibition of arguing during Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ</div><p>(nor should there be Jidal during Hajj) meaning, disputes and arguments. Ibn Jarir related that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ</div><p>(...nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.) means to argue with your companion (or fellow) until you make him angry. This is similar to the the opinion that Miqsam and Ad-Dahhak related to Ibn `Abbas. This is also the same meaning reported from Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ata', Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Jabir bin Zayd, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Makhul, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, `Amr bin Dinar, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Ata bin Yasar, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. </p><h2>The Encouragement for Righteous Deeds and to bring Provisions for Hajj</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And whatever good you do, Allah knows it.) </p><p>After Allah prohibited evil in deed and tongue, He encouraged righteous, good deeds, stating that He is knowledgeable of the good that they do, and He will reward them with the best awards on the Day of Resurrection. </p><p>Allah said next: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) </p><p>Al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The people of Yemen used to go to Hajj without taking enough supplies with them. They used to say, `We are those who have Tawakkul (reliance on Allah).' Allah revealed this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) </p><p>Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah narrated that Ibn `Umar said, \"When people assumed Ihram, they would throw away whatever provisions they had and would acquire other types of provisions. Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(And take a provisions (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) Allah forbade them from this practice and required them to take flour and Sawiq (a type of food usually eaten with dates) with them.\" </p><h2>The Provisions of the Hereafter</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</div><p>(...but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) When Allah required mankind to supply themselves with what sustains them for the journeys of this life, He directed them to the necessary provisions for the Hereafter: Taqwa. Allah said in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</div><p>(...and as an adornment; and the raiment of Taqwa, that is better.) (7:26) </p><p>Allah mentioned the material covering and then He mentioned the spiritual covering, which includes humbleness, obedience and Taqwa. He also stated that the latter provision is better and more beneficial than the former. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُونِ يأُوْلِي الأَلْبَـبِ</div><p>(So fear Me, O men of understanding!) meaning: `Fear My torment, punishment, and affliction for those who defy Me and do not adhere to My commands, O people of reason and understanding.' </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Commercial Transactions during Hajj</h2><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"`Ukaz, Mijannah and Dhul-Majaz were trading posts during the time of Jahiliyyah. During that era, they did not like the idea of conducting business transactions during the Hajj season. Later, this Ayah was revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord.) during the Hajj season.\" </p><p>Abu Dawud and others recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They used to avoid conducting business transactions during the Hajj season, saying that these are the days of Dhikr. Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading).) </p><p>This is also the explanation of Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mansur bin Al-Mu`tamir, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others. Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Umaymah said that when Ibn `Umar was asked about conducting trade during the Hajj, he recited the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading). ) </p><p>This Hadith is related to Ibn `Umar with a strong chain of narrators. This Hadith is also related to the Prophet , as Ahmad reported that Abu Umamah At-Taymi said, \"I asked Ibn `Umar, `We buy (and sell during the Hajj), so do we still have a valid Hajj' He said, `Do you not perform Tawaf around the House, stand at `Arafat, throw the pebbles and shave your heads' I said, `Yes.' Ibn `Umar said, `A man came to the Prophet and asked him about what you asked me, and the Prophet did not answer him until Jibril came down with this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading).) The Prophet summoned the man and said: (You are pilgrims).\" Ibn Jarir narrated that Abu Salih said to `Umar, \"`O Leader of the faithful! Did you conduct trade transactions during the Hajj\" He said, \"Was their livelihood except during Hajj\" </p><h2>Standing at `Arafat</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَآ أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَـتٍ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(Then when you leave `Arafat, remember Allah (by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations) at the Mash`ar-il-Haram.) </p><p>`Arafat is the place where one stands during the Hajj and it is a pillar of the rituals of Hajj. Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ya`mar Ad-Diyli said that he heard Allah's Messenger saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْحَجُّ عَرَفَاتٌ ثَلَاثًا فَمَنْ أَدْرَكَ عَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْرُ فَقَدْ أَدْرَكَ، وَأَيَّامُ مِنًى ثَلَاثَــةٌ، فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ، وَمَنْ تَأَخَّر فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيه»</div><p>(Hajj is `Arafat, (thrice). Hence, those who have stood at `Arafat before dawn will have performed (the rituals of the Hajj). The days of Mina are three, and there is no sin for those who move on after two days, or for those who stay.) </p><p>The time to stand on `Arafat starts from noon on the day of `Arafah until dawn the next day, which is the day of the Sacrifice (the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah). The Prophet stood at `Arafat during the Farewell Hajj, after he had offered the Zuhr (noon) prayer, until sunset. He said, \"Learn your rituals from me.\" In this Hadith (i. e., in the previous paragraph) he said, \"Whoever stood at `Arafat before dawn, will have performed (the rituals of Hajj).\" c`Urwah bin Mudarris bin Harithah bin Lam At-Ta'i said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger at Al-Muzdalifah when it was time to pray. I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I came from the two mountains of Tayy', and my animal became tired and I became tired. I have not left any mountain, but stood on it. Do I have a valid Hajj' Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ شَهِدَ صَلَاتَنَا هذِهِ، فَوَقَفَ مَعَنَا حَتَّى نَدْفَعَ، وَقَدْ وَقَفَ بِعَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ ذلِكَ لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهارًا فَقَدْ تَمَّ حَجُّهُ وَقَضَى تَفَثَه»</div><p>(Whoever performed this prayer with us, stood with us until we moved forth, and had stood at `Arafat before that, day or night, will have performed the Hajj and completed its rituals).\" </p><p>This Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sلahih. It was reported that the mount was called `Arafat because, as `Abdur-Razzaq reported that `Ali bin Abu Talib said, \"Allah sent Jibril to Prophet Ibrahim and he performed Hajj for him (to teach him its rituals). When Ibrahim reached `Arafat he said, `I have `Araftu (I know this place).' He had come to that area before. Thereafter, it was called `Arafat.\" Ibn Al-Mubarak said that `Ata' said, \"It was called `Arafat because Jibril used to teach Ibrahim the rituals of Hajj. Ibrahim would say, `I have `Araftu, I have `Araftu.' It was thereafter called `Arafat.\" Similar statements were attributed to Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar and Abu Mijlaz. Allah knows best. </p><p>`Arafat is also called Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram, Al-Mash`ar Al-Aqsa and Ilal, while the mount that is in the middle of `Arafat is called Jabal Ar-Rahmah (Mount of Mercy). </p><h2>The Time to leave `Arafat and Al-Muzdalifah</h2><p>Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to stand at `Arafat. When the sun would be on top of the mountains, just as the turban is on top of a man's head, they would move on. Allah's Messenger delayed moving from `Arafat until sunset.\" Ibn Marduwyah related this Hadith and added, \"He then stood at Al-Muzdalifah and offered the Fajr (Dawn) prayer at an early time. When the light of dawn broke, he moved on.\" This Hadith has a Hasan chain of narrators. The long Hadith that Jabir bin `Abdullah narrated, which Muslim collected, stated, \"The Prophet kept standing there (meaning at `Arafat) until sunset, when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. Then, the Prophet made Usamah sit behind him, and in order to keep her under control, pulled the nose string of Al-Qaswa' so hard, that its head touched the saddle. He gestured with his right hand and said, \"Proceed calmly people, calmly!\" Whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he lightly loosened the nose string of his camel till she climbed up and this is how they reached Al-Muzdalifah. There, he led the Maghrib (Evening) and `Isha' (Night) prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamah (which announces the imminent start of the acts of the prayer) and did not glorify Allah in between them (i.e., he did not perform voluntary Rak`ah). Allah's Messenger then laid down till dawn and offered the Fajr (Dawn) prayer with Adhan and Iqamah, when the morning light was clear. He again mounted Al-Qaswa', and when he came to Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram, he faced towards Qiblah, supplicated to Allah, glorifying Him and saying, La ilaha illallah, and he continued standing until the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose.\" </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Usamah bin Zayd was asked, \"How was the Prophet's pace when he moved\" He said, \"Slow, unless he found space, then he would go a little faster.\" </p><h2>Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram</h2><p>`Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn `Umar said that all of Al-Muzdalifah is Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram. It was reported that Ibn `Umar was asked about Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ</div><p>(...remember Allah (by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations) at the Mash`ar-il-Haram.) He said, \"It is the Mount and the surrounding area.\" It was reported that Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram is what is between the two Mounts (refer to the following Hadith), as Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Hasan and Qatadah have stated. </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ عَرَفَاتٍ مَوْقِفٌ، وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ عُرَنَةَ، وَكُلُّ مُزْدَلِفَةَ مَوْقِفٌ، وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ مُحَسِّرٍ، وَكُلُّ فِجَاجِ مَكَّةَ مَنْحَرٌ، وَكُلُّ أَيَّامِ التَّشْرِيقِ ذَبْح»</div><p>(All of `Arafat is a place of standing, and keep away from `Uranah. All of Al-Muzdalifah is a place for standing, and keep away from the bottom of Muhassir. All of the areas of Makkah are a place for sacrifice, and all of the days of Tashriq are days of sacrifice.) </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَاكُمْ</div><p>(And remember Him (by invoking Allah for all good) as He has guided you. ) </p><p>This Ayah reminds Muslims of Allah's bounty on them that He has directed and taught them the rituals of Hajj according to the guidance of Prophet Ibrahim Al-Khalil. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الضَّآلِّينَ</div><p>(...and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray.) </p><p>It was said that this Ayah refers to the condition before the guidance or the Qur'an or the Messenger , all of which are correct meanings. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Order to stand on `Arafat and to depart from it</h2><p>This Ayah contains Allah's order to those who stand at `Arafat to also move on to Al-Muzdalifah, so that they remember Allah at Al-Mash`ar Al-Haram. Allah commands the Muslim to stand with the rest of the pilgrims at `Arafat, unlike Quraysh who (before Islam) used to remain in the sanctuary, near Al-Muzdalifah, saying that they are the people of Allah's Town and the servants of His House. Al-Bukhari reported that `A'ishah said, \"Quraysh and their allies, who used to be called Al-Hums, used to stay in Al-Muzdalifah while the rest of the Arabs would stand at `Arafat. When Islam came, Allah commanded His Prophet to stand at `Arafat and then proceed from there. Hence Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ النَّاسُ</div><p>(...from the place whence all the people depart.) </p><p>This was also said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ata', Qatadah and As-Suddi and others. Ibn Jarir chose this opinion and said that there is Ijma` (a consensus among the scholars) for it. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of `Arafah, and I saw the Prophet standing in `Arafat. I said to myself, `By Allah he is from the Hums. What has brought him here\"' This Hadith is also reported in the Sahihayn. Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said that `depart' mentioned in the Ayah refers to proceeding from Al-Muzdalifah to Mina to stone the pillars. Allah knows best. </p><h2>Asking Allah for His Forgiveness</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْتَغْفِرُواْ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(...and ask Allah for His forgiveness. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.) </p><p>Allah frequently orders remembrance of Him after acts of worship are finished. Muslim reported that Allah's Messenger used to ask Allah for His forgiveness thrice after the prayer is finished. It is reported in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet encouraged Tasbih (saying Subhan Allah, i.e., Glorified is Allah), Tahmid (saying Al-Hamdu Lillah, i.e., praise be to Allah) and Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar, i.e., Allah is the Most Great) thirty-three times each (after prayer). </p><p>Ibn Marduwyah collected the Hadith that Al-Bukhari reported from Shaddad bin Aws, who stated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سَيِّدُ الْاِسْتِغْفَارِ أَنْ يَقُولَ الْعَبْدُ: اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي، لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ، وَأَنَا عَلى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ، أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ، وَأَبُوءُ بِذَنْبِي، فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إلَّا أَنْتَ، مَنْ قَالَهَا فِي لَيْلَةٍ فَمَاتَ فِي لَيْلَتِهِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّــةَ، وَمَنْ قَالَهَا فِي يَوْمِهِ فَمَاتَ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّــة»</div><p>(The master of supplication for forgiveness, is for the servant to say: `O Allah! You are my Lord, there is no deity worthy of worship except You. You have created me and I am Your servant. I am on Your covenant, as much as I can be, and awaiting Your promise. I seek refuge with You from the evil that I have committed. I admit Your favor on me and admit my faults. So forgive me, for none except You forgives the sins.' Whoever said these words at night and died that same night will enter Paradise. Whoever said it during the day and died will enter Paradise.) </p><p>Furthermore, it is reported in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that Abu Bakr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Teach me an invocation so that I may invoke (Allah) with it in my prayer. He told me to say: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قُلْ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي ظُلْمًا كَثِيرًا وَلَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ فَاغْفِرْ لِي مَغْفِرَةً مِنْ عِنْدِكَ، وَارْحَمْنِي إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيم»</div><p>(Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman kathiran, wa la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta faghfirli maghfiratan min `indika, war-hamni innaka Antal-Ghafur-ur-Rahim (O Allah!

The only Dhikr that they had was that they would remember the deeds of their fathers. Allah then revealed to Muhammad : </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ءَابَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا</div><p>(Remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with far more remembrance.) </p><p>Therefore, remembering Allah the Exalted and Ever High is always encouraged. We should mention that when Allah used \"or\" in the Ayah, He meant to encourage the people to remember Him more than they remember their forefathers, not that the word entails a doubt (as to which is larger or bigger). This statement is similar to the Ayat: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</div><p>(...as stones or even worse in hardness) (2:74) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</div><p>(. ..fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ </div><p>(And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more) (37:147) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى </div><p>(And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer.) (53:9) </p><p>Allah encourages calling Him in supplication after remembering Him, because this will make it more likely that the supplication will be accepted. Allah also criticizes those who only supplicate to Him about the affairs of this life, while ignoring the affairs of the Hereafter. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَـقٍ</div><p>(But of mankind there are some who say: \"Our Lord! Give us (Your bounties) in this world!\" and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter.) qmeaning, they have no share in the Hereafter. This criticism serves to discourage other people from imitating those mentioned. </p><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Some bedouins used to come to the standing area (`Arafat) and supplicate saying, `O Allah! Make it a rainy year, a fertile year and a year of good child bearing.' They would not mention any of the affairs of the Hereafter. Thus, Allah revealed about them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَـقٍ</div><p>(But of mankind there are some who say: \"Our Lord! Give us (Your bounties) in this world!\" and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter.) </p><p>The believers who came after them used to say: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الاٌّخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</div><p>(Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!\") </p><p>Next, Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ </div><p>(For them there will be alloted a share for what they have earned. And Allah is swift at reckoning.) </p><p>Hence, Allah praised those who ask for the affairs of both this life and the Hereafter. He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وِمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الاٌّخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ </div><p>(And of them there are some who say: \"Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!\") </p><p>The supplication mentioned and praised in the Ayah includes all good aspects of this life and seeks refuge from all types of evil. The good of this life concerns every material request of well-being, spacious dwelling, pleasing mates, sufficient provision, beneficial knowledge, good profession or deeds, comfortable means of transportation and good praise, all of which the scholars of Tafsir have mentioned regarding this subject. All of these are but a part of the good that is sought in this life. As for the good of the Hereafter, the best of this includes acquiring Paradise, which also means acquiring safety from the greatest horror at the gathering place. It also refers to being questioned lightly and the other favors in the Hereafter. </p><p>As for acquiring safety from the Fire, it includes being directed to what leads to this good end in this world, such as avoiding the prohibitions, sins of all kinds and doubtful matters. </p><p>Al-Qasim bin `Abdur-Rahman said, \"Whoever is gifted with a grateful heart, a remembering tongue and a patient body, will have been endowed with a good deed in this life, a good deed in the Hereafter and saved from the torment of the Fire.\" </p><p>This is why the Sunnah encourages reciting this Du`a' (i.e., in the Ayah about gaining a good deed in this life and the Hereafter). Al-Bukhari reported that Anas bin Malik narrated that the Prophet used to say: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً، وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَــةً، وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّار»</div><p>(O Allah, our Lord! Give us that which is good in this life, that which is good in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the Fire.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Anas said, \"Allah's Messenger visited a Muslim man who had become as weak as a sick small bird. Allah's Messenger said to him, `Were you asking or supplicating to Allah about something' He said, `Yes. I used to say: O Allah! Whatever punishment you saved for me in the Hereafter, give it to me in this life.' Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«سُبْحَانَ اللهِ لَا تُطِيقُهُ أَوْ لَا تَسْتَطِيعُهُ، فَهَلَّا قُلْتَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الاٌّخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</div><p>( </p><p>(All praise is due to Allah! You cannot bear it -or stand it-. You should have said: (Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!)) </p><p>The man began reciting this Du`a and he was cured.\" Muslim also recorded it. </p><p>Al-Hakim reported that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"A man came to Ibn `Abbas and said, `I worked for some people and settled for a part of my compensation in return for their taking me to perform Hajj with them. Is this acceptable' Ibn `Abbas said, `You are among those whom Allah described: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ </div><p>(For them there will be alloted a share for what they have earned.

These are days of eating and drinking.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Nubayshah Al-Hudhali said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وشُرْبٍ وَذِكْرِ الله»</div><p>(The days of Tashriq are days of eating, drinking and Dhikr (remembering) of Allah.) </p><p>Muslim also recorded this Haith </p><p>We also mentioned the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«عَرَفَةُ كُلُّهَا مَوْقِفٌ، وَأيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»</div><p>(All of `Arafat is a standing place and all of the days of Tashriq are days of Sacrifice. ) </p><p>We also mentioned the Hadith by `Abdur-Rahman bin Ya`mar Ad-Diyli: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَأَيَّامُ مِنىً ثَلَاثَةٌ فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْه»</div><p>(The days of Mina (Tashriq) are three. Those who hasten in two days then there is no sin in it, and those who delay (i.e., remain in Mina for a third day) then there is no sin in it.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ أيَّامُ طُعْمٍ وَذِكْرِ الله»</div><p>(The days of Tashriq are days of eating and remembering Allah.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger sent `Abdullah bin Hudhafah to Mina proclaiming: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَصُومُوا هذِه الْأَيَّامَ، فَإنَّهَا أَيَّامُ أَكْلٍ وَشُرْبٍ وَذِكْرِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»</div><p>(Do not fast these days (i.e., Tashriq days), for they are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.) </p><h2>The Appointed Days</h2><p>Miqsam said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Appointed Days are the days of Tashriq, four days: the day of the Sacrifice (10th of Dhul-Hijjah) and three days after that. </p><p>This opinion was also reported of Ibn `Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Musa, `Ata', Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Yahya bin Abu Kathir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Malik bin Anas, and others. In addition, the apparent meaning of the following Ayah supports this opinion: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him.) </p><p>So the Ayah hints to the three days after the day of Sacrifice. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ فِى أَيَّامٍ مَّعْدُودَتٍ</div><p>(And remember Allah during the Appointed Days) directs remembering Allah upon slaughtering the animals, after the prayers, and by Dhikr (supplication) in general. It also includes Takbir and remembering Allah while throwing the pebbles every day during the Tashriq days. A Hadith that Abu Dawud and several others collected states: </p><p>إِنَّمَا جُعِلَ الطَّوَافُ بِالْبَيْتِ وَالسَّعْيُ بَيْنَ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةِ وَرَمْيُ الْجِمَارِ لإِقَامَةِ ذِكْرِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ </p><p>(Tawaf around the House, Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and throwing the pebbles were legislated so that Allah is remembered in Dhikr.) </p><p>When mentioning the first procession (refer to 2:199) and the second procession of the people upon the end of the Hajj season, when they start to return to their areas, after they had gathered during the rituals and at the standing places, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ</div><p>(and obey Allah (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.) </p><p>Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى ذَرَأَكُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ </div><p>(And it is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered back.)

Thereafter, Allah sent down His condemnation of the hypocrites and His praise for Khubayb and his companions: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>It was also said that they refer to the hypocrites and the believers in general. This is the opinion of Qatadah, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and several others, and it is correct. </p><p>Ibn Jarir related that Al-Qurazi said that Nawf Al-Bikali, who used to read (previous Divine) Books said, \"I find the description of some members of this Ummah in the previously revealed Books of Allah: they (hypocrites) are people who use the religion to gain material benefit. Their tongues are sweeter than honey, but their hearts are more bitter than Sabir (a bitter plant, aloe). They show the people the appearance of sheep while their hearts hide the viciousness of wolves. Allah said, `They dare challenge Me, but they are deceived by Me. I swear by Myself that I will send a Fitnah (trial, calamity) on them that will make the wise man bewildered.' I contemplated about these statements and found them in the Qur'an describing the hypocrites: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا فِى قَلْبِهِ</div><p>(And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you (O Muhammad ), in this worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,) </p><p>This statement by Al-Qurazi is Hasan Sahih. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا فِى قَلْبِهِ</div><p>(...and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that such people pretend to be Muslims, but defy Allah by the disbelief and hypocrisy that their hearts conceal. Similarly Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلاَ يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(They may hide (their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (them) from Allah.) (4:108) </p><p>This Tafsir was reported from Ibn `Abbas by Ibn Ishaq. It was also said that the Ayah means that when such people announce their Islam, they swear by Allah that what is in their hearts is the same of what their tongues are pronouncing. This is also a correct meaning for the Ayah that was chosen by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. It is also the choice of Ibn Jarir who related it to Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid. Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ الْخِصَامِ</div><p>(Yet he is the most Aladd of the opponents.) (2:204) lThe Ayah used the word Aladd here, which literally means `wicked' (here it means `quarrelsome'). A variation of the word Ludda was also used in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً</div><p>(So that you (Muhammad) warn with it (the Qur'an) a Ludda people.) (19:97) </p><p>Hence, a hypocrite lies, alters the truth when he quarrels and does not care for the truth. Rather, he deviates from the truth, deceives and becomes most quarrelsome. It is reported in Sahih that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإذَا عَاهَدَ غَدَرَ، وَإِذَا خَاصَمَ فَجَر»</div><p>(The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise). If you have a dispute with him, he is most quarrelsome.) </p><p>Imam Bukhari reported that `A'ishah narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ أَبْغَضَ الرِّجَالِ إلَى اللهِ الْألَدُّ الْخَصِم»</div><p>(The most hated person to Allah is he who is Aladd and Khasim (meaning most quarrelsome).) </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا تَوَلَّى سَعَى فِى الاٌّرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ </div><p>(And when he turns away (from you O Muhammad), he struggles in the land to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle, and Allah likes not mischief.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that such persons are deviant in the tongue, evil in the deeds, their words are fabricated, their belief is wicked and their works are immoral. The Ayah used the (Arabic word) Sa`a (literally, `tries' or `intends'). This word was also used to describe Pharaoh: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَى - فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى - إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى </div><p>(Then he turned his back, Yas`a (striving hard against Allah). Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud saying, `I am your lord, most high.' So Allah, seized him with a punishing example for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.) (79:22-26) </p><p>Sa`a was also used in the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْاْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), As`aw come to the remembrance of Allah.) (62:9) </p><p>This Ayah means, `(when the call to the Friday prayer is announced) intend and then proceed to attend the Friday prayer.' We should mention that hastening to the mosque is condemed by the Sunnah (as this is another meaning for the word Sa`a): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إذَا أَتَيْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَلَا تَأْتُوهَا وَأَنْتُمْ تَسْعَوْنَ، وَأْتُوهَا وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّكِينَةُ والْوَقَار»</div><p>(When you come to attend the prayer, do not come in a Sa`i (haste). Rather, come to it while walking at ease and in peace (or grace). ) </p><p>The hypocrite has no motive in this life but to cause mischief and to destroy the crops and the offspring, including what the animals produce and what the people depend on for their livelihood. Mujahid said, \"If the hypocrite strives for mischief in the land, Allah prevents the rain from falling and thus the crops and the offspring perish.\" The Ayah continues: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ</div><p>(...and Allah likes not mischief.) that is, Allah does not like those who possess these characteristics, or those who act like this. </p><h2>Rejecting Advice is Characteristic of the Hypocrites</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالإِثْمِ</div><p>(And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", he is led by arrogance to (more) crime.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that when the hypocrite, who deviates in his speech and deeds, is advised and commanded to fear Allah, refrain from his evil deeds and adhere to the truth, he refuses and becomes angry and outraged, as he is used to doing evil. This Ayah is similar to what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا بَيِّنَـتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِى وُجُوهِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمُنْكَرَ يَكَـدُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِالَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذلِكُمُ النَّارُ وَعَدَهَا اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our verses to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you of something worse than that The Fire (of Hell) which Allah has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!) (22:72) </p><p>This is why in this Ayah, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ</div><p>(So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest) meaning, the Fire is enough punishment for the hypocrite. </p><h2>The Sincere Believer prefers pleasing Allah</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>After Allah described the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He mentioned the good qualities of the believers. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas, Anas, Sa`id bin Musayyib, Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi, `Ikrimah and several other scholars said that this Ayah was revealed about Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi. When Suhayb became a Muslim in Makkah and intended to migrate (to Al-Madinah), the people (Quraysh) prevented him from migrating with his money. They said that if he forfeits his property, he is free to migrate. He abandoned his money and preferred to migrate, and Allah revealed this Ayah about him. `Umar bin Khattab and several other Companions met Suhayb close to the outskirts of Al-Madinah at Al-Harrah (flat lands with black stones). They said to him, \"The trade has indeed been successful.\" He answered them, \"You too, may Allah never allow your trade to fail. What is the matter\" `Umar told him that Allah has revealed this Ayah (2:207) about him. It was also reported that Allah's Messenger said, \"The trade has been successful, O Suhayb!\" </p><p>The meaning of the Ayah (2:207) includes every Mujahid in the way of Allah. Allah said in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَلَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الّجَنَّةَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْءانِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُواْ بِبَيْعِكُمُ الَّذِى بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.) (9:111) </p><p>When Hisham bin `Amr penetrated the lines of the enemy, some people criticized him. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu Hurayrah refuted them and recited this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ </div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to (His) servants.) </p>"

Mujahid said, \"If the hypocrite strives for mischief in the land, Allah prevents the rain from falling and thus the crops and the offspring perish.\" The Ayah continues: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ</div><p>(...and Allah likes not mischief.) that is, Allah does not like those who possess these characteristics, or those who act like this. </p><h2>Rejecting Advice is Characteristic of the Hypocrites</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالإِثْمِ</div><p>(And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", he is led by arrogance to (more) crime.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that when the hypocrite, who deviates in his speech and deeds, is advised and commanded to fear Allah, refrain from his evil deeds and adhere to the truth, he refuses and becomes angry and outraged, as he is used to doing evil. This Ayah is similar to what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا بَيِّنَـتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِى وُجُوهِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمُنْكَرَ يَكَـدُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِالَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذلِكُمُ النَّارُ وَعَدَهَا اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our verses to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you of something worse than that The Fire (of Hell) which Allah has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!) (22:72) </p><p>This is why in this Ayah, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ</div><p>(So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest) meaning, the Fire is enough punishment for the hypocrite. </p><h2>The Sincere Believer prefers pleasing Allah</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>After Allah described the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He mentioned the good qualities of the believers.

When Suhayb became a Muslim in Makkah and intended to migrate (to Al-Madinah), the people (Quraysh) prevented him from migrating with his money. They said that if he forfeits his property, he is free to migrate. He abandoned his money and preferred to migrate, and Allah revealed this Ayah about him. `Umar bin Khattab and several other Companions met Suhayb close to the outskirts of Al-Madinah at Al-Harrah (flat lands with black stones). They said to him, \"The trade has indeed been successful.\" He answered them, \"You too, may Allah never allow your trade to fail. What is the matter\" `Umar told him that Allah has revealed this Ayah (2:207) about him. It was also reported that Allah's Messenger said, \"The trade has been successful, O Suhayb!\" </p><p>The meaning of the Ayah (2:207) includes every Mujahid in the way of Allah. Allah said in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَلَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الّجَنَّةَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْءانِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُواْ بِبَيْعِكُمُ الَّذِى بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.) (9:111) </p><p>When Hisham bin `Amr penetrated the lines of the enemy, some people criticized him. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu Hurayrah refuted them and recited this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ </div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.

Their tongues are sweeter than honey, but their hearts are more bitter than Sabir (a bitter plant, aloe). They show the people the appearance of sheep while their hearts hide the viciousness of wolves. Allah said, `They dare challenge Me, but they are deceived by Me. I swear by Myself that I will send a Fitnah (trial, calamity) on them that will make the wise man bewildered.' I contemplated about these statements and found them in the Qur'an describing the hypocrites: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا فِى قَلْبِهِ</div><p>(And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you (O Muhammad ), in this worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,) </p><p>This statement by Al-Qurazi is Hasan Sahih.

(4:108) </p><p>This Tafsir was reported from Ibn `Abbas by Ibn Ishaq. It was also said that the Ayah means that when such people announce their Islam, they swear by Allah that what is in their hearts is the same of what their tongues are pronouncing. This is also a correct meaning for the Ayah that was chosen by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. It is also the choice of Ibn Jarir who related it to Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid. Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ الْخِصَامِ</div><p>(Yet he is the most Aladd of the opponents.)

(19:97) </p><p>Hence, a hypocrite lies, alters the truth when he quarrels and does not care for the truth. Rather, he deviates from the truth, deceives and becomes most quarrelsome. It is reported in Sahih that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإذَا عَاهَدَ غَدَرَ، وَإِذَا خَاصَمَ فَجَر»</div><p>(The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.

Mujahid said, \"If the hypocrite strives for mischief in the land, Allah prevents the rain from falling and thus the crops and the offspring perish.\" The Ayah continues: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ</div><p>(...and Allah likes not mischief.) that is, Allah does not like those who possess these characteristics, or those who act like this. </p><h2>Rejecting Advice is Characteristic of the Hypocrites</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالإِثْمِ</div><p>(And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", he is led by arrogance to (more) crime.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that when the hypocrite, who deviates in his speech and deeds, is advised and commanded to fear Allah, refrain from his evil deeds and adhere to the truth, he refuses and becomes angry and outraged, as he is used to doing evil. This Ayah is similar to what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا بَيِّنَـتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِى وُجُوهِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمُنْكَرَ يَكَـدُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِالَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذلِكُمُ النَّارُ وَعَدَهَا اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ </div><p>(And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our verses to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you of something worse than that The Fire (of Hell) which Allah has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!) (22:72) </p><p>This is why in this Ayah, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ</div><p>(So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest) meaning, the Fire is enough punishment for the hypocrite. </p><h2>The Sincere Believer prefers pleasing Allah</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>After Allah described the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He mentioned the good qualities of the believers. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas, Anas, Sa`id bin Musayyib, Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi, `Ikrimah and several other scholars said that this Ayah was revealed about Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi. When Suhayb became a Muslim in Makkah and intended to migrate (to Al-Madinah), the people (Quraysh) prevented him from migrating with his money. They said that if he forfeits his property, he is free to migrate. He abandoned his money and preferred to migrate, and Allah revealed this Ayah about him. `Umar bin Khattab and several other Companions met Suhayb close to the outskirts of Al-Madinah at Al-Harrah (flat lands with black stones). They said to him, \"The trade has indeed been successful.\" He answered them, \"You too, may Allah never allow your trade to fail. What is the matter\" `Umar told him that Allah has revealed this Ayah (2:207) about him. It was also reported that Allah's Messenger said, \"The trade has been successful, O Suhayb!\" </p><p>The meaning of the Ayah (2:207) includes every Mujahid in the way of Allah. Allah said in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَى مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَلَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الّجَنَّةَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْءانِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَى بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُواْ بِبَيْعِكُمُ الَّذِى بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.) (9:111) </p><p>When Hisham bin `Amr penetrated the lines of the enemy, some people criticized him. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu Hurayrah refuted them and recited this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ </div><p>(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to (His) servants.) </p>"

When he was about to march, he started crying for the thought of missing Allah's Messenger . Consequently, the Messenger relieved Abu `Ubaydah from command, appointed `Abdullah bin Jahsh instead, gave him some written instructions and commanded him not to read the instructions until he reached such and such area. He also said to `Abdullah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُكْرِهَنَّ أَحَدًا عَلَى السَّيْرِ مَعَكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِك».</div><p>(Do not compel any of your men to continue marching with you thereafter.) </p><p>When `Abdullah read the instructions, he recited Istirja` saying, `Truly! to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return'; and refer to (2:156) and said, \"I hear and obey Allah and His Messenger.\" He then told his companions the story and read the instructions to them, and two men went back while the rest remained. Soon after, they found Ibn Hadrami (one of the disbelievers of Quraysh) and killed him not knowing that that day was in Rajab or Jumadi (where Rajab is the Sacred Month). The polytheists said to the Muslims, \"You have committed murder in the Sacred Month.\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ</div><p>(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression)...\") </p><p>Abdul-Malik bin Hisham, who compiled the Sirah (life story of the Prophet ), related that Ziyad bin `Abdullah Bakka'i said that Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar Al-Madani wrote in his book on the Sirah, \"Allah's Messenger sent `Abdullah bin Jahsh bin Riyab Al-Asadi in Rajab, after he (the Prophet ) came back from the first battle of Badr. The Prophet sent eight people with him, all from among the Muhajirun and none from the Ansar. He also gave him some written instructions and ordered him not to read them until he marched for two days. `Abdullah should then read the instructions and march to implement them, but should not force any of those who were with him to accompany him. </p><p>The companions of `Abdullah bin Jahsh were all from the Muhajirun, from the tribe of Banu `Abd Shams bin `Abd Manaf, there was Abu Hudhayfah bin `Utbah bin Rabi`ah bin `Abd Shams bin `Abd Manaf. From their allies, there was `Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was the commander of the army unit, and `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from the tribe of Banu Asad bin Khuzaymah. From the tribe of Banu Nawfal bin `Abd Manaf, there was `Utbah bin Ghazwan bin Jabir, one of their allies. From the tribe of Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab, there was Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas. From Banu Ka`b, there were their allies: `Adi bin `Amr bin Ar-Rabi`ah not from the tribe of Ibn Wa'il; Waqid bin `Abdullah bin `Abd Manaf bin `Arin bin Tha`labah bin Yarbu` from Banu Tamim; and Khalid bin Bukair from the tribe of Banu Sa`d bin Layth, Suhayl bin Bayda' from Banu Al-Harith bin Fihr was also among them. When `Abdullah bin Jahsh marched for two days, he opened and read the (Prophet's) instructions, \"When you read these instructions, march until you set camp at Nakhlah between Makkah and At-Ta'if. There, watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and collect news about them for us.\" When `Abdullah bin Jahsh read the document, he said, \"I hear and obey.\" He then said to his companions, \"Allah's Messenger has commanded me to march forth to Nakhlah to watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and to inform him about their news. He has prohibited me from forcing any of you (to go with me). So, those who seek martyrdom, they should march with me. Those who dislike the idea of martyrdom, let them turn back. Surely, I will implement the command of Allah's Messenger .\" He and his companions continued without any of them turning back. </p><p>`Abdullah entered the Hijaz area (western Arabia) until he reached an area called Buhran, close to Furu`. There, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Utbah bin Ghazwan lost the camel that they were riding in turns, and they went back to search for it while `Abdullah bin Jahsh and the rest of his companions continued until they reached Nakhlah. Then, a caravan belonging to the Quraysh passed by carrying raisins, food stuff and some trade items for the Quraysh. `Amr bin Hadrami, whose name was `Abdullah bin `Abbad, was in the caravan, as well as `Uthman bin `Abdullah bin Al-Mughirah and his brother Nawfal bin `Abdullah from the tribe of Makhzum, and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, a freed slave of Hisham bin Al-Mughirah. When they saw the Companions they were frightened, but when they saw `Ukkashah bin Mihsan their fears subsided, since his head was shaved. They said, \"These people seek the `Umrah, so there is no need to fear them.\" </p><p>The Companions conferred among themselves. That day was the last day in the (sacred) month of Rajab. They said to each other, \"By Allah! If you let them pass, they will soon enter the Sacred Area and take refuge in it from you. If you kill them, you will kill them during the Sacred Month.\" They at first hesitated and did not like to attack them. They then began encouraging themselves and decided to kill whomever they could among the disbelievers and to confiscate whatever they had. Hence, Waqid bin `Abdullah At-Tamimi shot an arrow at `Amr bin Al-Hadrami and killed him. `Uthman bin `Abdullah and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan gave themselves up, while Nawfal bin `Abdullah was able to outrun them in flight. Later on, `Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions went back to Allah's Messenger in Al-Madinah with the caravan and the two prisoners. dIbn Ishaq went on: I was told that some members of the family of `Abdullah bin Jahsh said that `Abdullah said to his companions: \"Allah's Messenger will have one-fifth of what we have confiscated.\" This occurred before Allah required one-fifth for His Messenger from the war booty. So, `Abdullah designated one-fifth of the caravan for Allah's Messenger and divided the rest among his companions. Ibn Ishaq also stated that at first, when the Sariyah came back to Allah's Messenger , he said to them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِقِتَالٍ فِي الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَام»</div><p>(I have not commanded you to conduct warfare during the Sacred Month. ) </p><p>He left the caravan and the two prisoners alone and did not take any share of the war booty. </p><p>When Allah's Messenger did that, the soldiers from the attack were concerned and felt that they were destroyed, and their Muslim brethren criticized them for what they did. The Quraysh said that Muhammad and his Companions violated the sanctity of the Sacred Month and shed blood, confiscated property and took prisoners during it. Those who refuted them among the Muslims who remained in Makkah replied that the Muslims had done that during the month of Sha`ban (which is not a sacred month). Meanwhile, the Jews were pleased about what happened to Allah's Messenger . They said, ` Amr bin Hadrami was killed by Waqid bin `Abdullah: `Amr, means the war has started, Hadrami means the war has come, as for Waqid (bin `Abdullah): the war has raged (using some of the literal meanings of these names to support their fortune-telling!).\" But, Allah made all that turn against them. </p><p>The people continued talking about this matter, then Allah revealed to His Messenger : </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) </p><p>This Ayah means, `If you had killed during the Sacred Month, they (disbelievers of Quraysh) have hindered you from the path of Allah and disbelieved in it. They also prevented you from entering the Sacred Mosque, and expelled you from it, while you are its people, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(...a greater (transgression) with Allah) than killing whom you killed among them. Also: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</div><p>(...and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) means, trying to force the Muslims to revert from their religion and re-embrace Kufr after they had believed, is worse with Allah than killing.' Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّى يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعُواْ</div><p>(And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic Monotheism) if they can.) </p><p>So, they will go on fighting you with unrelenting viciousness. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq went on: When the Qur'an touched this subject and Allah brought relief to the Muslims instead of the sadness that had befallen them, Allah's Messenger took possession of the caravan and the two prisoners. The Quraysh offered to ransom the two prisoners, `Uthman bin `Abdullah and Hakam bin Kaysan. Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا نَفْدِيكُمُوهُمَا حَتَّى يَقْدَمَ صَاحِبَانَا»</div><p>(We will not accept your ransom until our two companions return safely. ) meaning Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Utbah bin Ghazwan, \"For we fear for their safety with you. If you kill them, we will kill your people.\" Later on, Sa`d and `Utbah returned safely and Allah's Messenger accepted the Quraysh's ransom for their prisoners. As for Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, he became Muslim and his Islam strengthened. He remained with Allah's Messenger until he was martyred during the incident at Bir Ma`unah (when the Prophet sent seventy Companions to Najd to teach them Islam, but Banu Sulaim killed them all except two). As for `Uthman bin `Abdullah, he went back to Makkah and died there as a disbeliever. </p><p>Ibn Ishaq went on: When `Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions were relieved from their depressing thoughts after the Qur'an was revealed about this subject, they sought the reward of the fighters (in Allah's way). They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! We wish that this incident be considered a battle for us, so that we gain the rewards of the Mujahidin.\" Then, Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَجَـهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أُوْلـئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَةَ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(Verily, those who have believed, and those who have emigrated (for Allah's religion) and have striven hard in the way of Allah, all these hope for Allah's mercy. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) </p><p>Hence, Allah has greatly elevated their hopes of gaining what they had wished for. </p>"

When he was about to march, he started crying for the thought of missing Allah's Messenger . Consequently, the Messenger relieved Abu `Ubaydah from command, appointed `Abdullah bin Jahsh instead, gave him some written instructions and commanded him not to read the instructions until he reached such and such area. He also said to `Abdullah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُكْرِهَنَّ أَحَدًا عَلَى السَّيْرِ مَعَكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِك».</div><p>(Do not compel any of your men to continue marching with you thereafter.) </p><p>When `Abdullah read the instructions, he recited Istirja` saying, `Truly! to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return'; and refer to (2:156) and said, \"I hear and obey Allah and His Messenger.\" He then told his companions the story and read the instructions to them, and two men went back while the rest remained. Soon after, they found Ibn Hadrami (one of the disbelievers of Quraysh) and killed him not knowing that that day was in Rajab or Jumadi (where Rajab is the Sacred Month). The polytheists said to the Muslims, \"You have committed murder in the Sacred Month.\" Allah then revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ</div><p>(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression)...\") </p><p>Abdul-Malik bin Hisham, who compiled the Sirah (life story of the Prophet ), related that Ziyad bin `Abdullah Bakka'i said that Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar Al-Madani wrote in his book on the Sirah, \"Allah's Messenger sent `Abdullah bin Jahsh bin Riyab Al-Asadi in Rajab, after he (the Prophet ) came back from the first battle of Badr. The Prophet sent eight people with him, all from among the Muhajirun and none from the Ansar. He also gave him some written instructions and ordered him not to read them until he marched for two days. `Abdullah should then read the instructions and march to implement them, but should not force any of those who were with him to accompany him. </p><p>The companions of `Abdullah bin Jahsh were all from the Muhajirun, from the tribe of Banu `Abd Shams bin `Abd Manaf, there was Abu Hudhayfah bin `Utbah bin Rabi`ah bin `Abd Shams bin `Abd Manaf. From their allies, there was `Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was the commander of the army unit, and `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from the tribe of Banu Asad bin Khuzaymah. From the tribe of Banu Nawfal bin `Abd Manaf, there was `Utbah bin Ghazwan bin Jabir, one of their allies. From the tribe of Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab, there was Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas. From Banu Ka`b, there were their allies: `Adi bin `Amr bin Ar-Rabi`ah not from the tribe of Ibn Wa'il; Waqid bin `Abdullah bin `Abd Manaf bin `Arin bin Tha`labah bin Yarbu` from Banu Tamim; and Khalid bin Bukair from the tribe of Banu Sa`d bin Layth, Suhayl bin Bayda' from Banu Al-Harith bin Fihr was also among them. When `Abdullah bin Jahsh marched for two days, he opened and read the (Prophet's) instructions, \"When you read these instructions, march until you set camp at Nakhlah between Makkah and At-Ta'if. There, watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and collect news about them for us.\" When `Abdullah bin Jahsh read the document, he said, \"I hear and obey.\" He then said to his companions, \"Allah's Messenger has commanded me to march forth to Nakhlah to watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and to inform him about their news. He has prohibited me from forcing any of you (to go with me). So, those who seek martyrdom, they should march with me. Those who dislike the idea of martyrdom, let them turn back. Surely, I will implement the command of Allah's Messenger .\" He and his companions continued without any of them turning back. </p><p>`Abdullah entered the Hijaz area (western Arabia) until he reached an area called Buhran, close to Furu`. There, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Utbah bin Ghazwan lost the camel that they were riding in turns, and they went back to search for it while `Abdullah bin Jahsh and the rest of his companions continued until they reached Nakhlah. Then, a caravan belonging to the Quraysh passed by carrying raisins, food stuff and some trade items for the Quraysh. `Amr bin Hadrami, whose name was `Abdullah bin `Abbad, was in the caravan, as well as `Uthman bin `Abdullah bin Al-Mughirah and his brother Nawfal bin `Abdullah from the tribe of Makhzum, and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, a freed slave of Hisham bin Al-Mughirah. When they saw the Companions they were frightened, but when they saw `Ukkashah bin Mihsan their fears subsided, since his head was shaved. They said, \"These people seek the `Umrah, so there is no need to fear them.\" </p><p>The Companions conferred among themselves. That day was the last day in the (sacred) month of Rajab. They said to each other, \"By Allah! If you let them pass, they will soon enter the Sacred Area and take refuge in it from you. If you kill them, you will kill them during the Sacred Month.\" They at first hesitated and did not like to attack them. They then began encouraging themselves and decided to kill whomever they could among the disbelievers and to confiscate whatever they had. Hence, Waqid bin `Abdullah At-Tamimi shot an arrow at `Amr bin Al-Hadrami and killed him. `Uthman bin `Abdullah and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan gave themselves up, while Nawfal bin `Abdullah was able to outrun them in flight. Later on, `Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions went back to Allah's Messenger in Al-Madinah with the caravan and the two prisoners. dIbn Ishaq went on: I was told that some members of the family of `Abdullah bin Jahsh said that `Abdullah said to his companions: \"Allah's Messenger will have one-fifth of what we have confiscated.\" This occurred before Allah required one-fifth for His Messenger from the war booty.

Yet, he still said, \"O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.\" Then, the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed, `Umar was again summoned and the Ayah was recited to him. When he reached: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ</div><p>(So, will you not then abstain) (5:91) he said, \"We did abstain, we did abstain.\" This is also the narration that Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasai collected in their books. `Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi said that the chain of narrators for this Hadith is sound and authentic. We will mention this Hadith again along with what Imam Ahmad collected by Abu Hurayrah Allah's saying in Surat Al-Ma'idah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(Intoxicants and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam are an abomination of Satan's handiwork.

Also, (their benefit includes) earnings through gambling that one uses to spend on his family and on himself. Yet, these benefits are outweighed by the clear harm that they cause which affects the mind and the religion. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِثْمُهُمَآ أَكْبَرُ مِن نَّفْعِهِمَا</div><p>(...but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.) </p><p>This Ayah was the beginning of the process of prohibiting Khamr, not explicity, but it only implied this meaning. So when this Ayah was recited to `Umar, he still said, \"O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.\" Soon after, Allah sent down a clear prohibition of Khamr in Surat Al-Ma'idah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ - إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَآءَ فِى الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَعَنِ الصَّلَوةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ </div><p>(O you who believe!

Yet, he still said, \"O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.\" Then, the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed, `Umar was again summoned and the Ayah was recited to him. When he reached: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ</div><p>(So, will you not then abstain) (5:91) he said, \"We did abstain, we did abstain.\" This is also the narration that Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasai collected in their books. `Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi said that the chain of narrators for this Hadith is sound and authentic. We will mention this Hadith again along with what Imam Ahmad collected by Abu Hurayrah Allah's saying in Surat Al-Ma'idah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(Intoxicants and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam are an abomination of Satan's handiwork.

As for their benefit, it is material, including benefit for the body, digesting the food, getting rid of the excrements, sharpening the mind, bringing about a joyous sensation and financially benefiting from their sale. Also, (their benefit includes) earnings through gambling that one uses to spend on his family and on himself. Yet, these benefits are outweighed by the clear harm that they cause which affects the mind and the religion. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِثْمُهُمَآ أَكْبَرُ مِن نَّفْعِهِمَا</div><p>(...but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.) </p><p>This Ayah was the beginning of the process of prohibiting Khamr, not explicity, but it only implied this meaning. So when this Ayah was recited to `Umar, he still said, \"O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.\" Soon after, Allah sent down a clear prohibition of Khamr in Surat Al-Ma'idah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ - إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَآءَ فِى الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَعَنِ الصَّلَوةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ </div><p>(O you who believe!

Masruq said, \"I wish to ask you about a matter, but I am shy.\" She replied, \"I am your mother and you are my son.\" He said, \"What can the man enjoy of his wife when she is having her menses\" She said, \"Everything except her sexual organ.\" This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and `Ikrimah. </p><p>One is allowed to sleep next to his wife and to eat with her (when she is having her menses). `A'ishah said, \"Allah's Messenger used to ask me to wash his hair while I was having the menses. He would lay on my lap and read the Qur'an while I was having the period.\" It is also reported in the Sahih that `A'ishah said, \"While having the menses, I used to eat from a piece of meat and give it to the Prophet who would eat from the same place I ate from. I used to have sips of a drink and would then give the cup to the Prophet who would place his mouth where I placed my mouth.\" </p><p>It is also reported in the Two Sahihs that Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyah said, \"Whenever the Prophet wanted to fondle any of his wives during the periods (menses), he used to ask her to wear an Izar (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).\" These are the wordings collected by Al-Bukhari. Similar was reported from `A'ishah. In addition, Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported that `Abdullah bin Sa`d Al-Ansari asked Allah's Messenger , \"What am I allowed of my wife while she is having her menses\" He said, \"What is above the Izar (a sheet covering the lower-half of the body).\" Hence, Allah's statement: h </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ</div><p>(...and go not in unto them till they are purified.) explains His statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاعْتَزِلُواْ النِّسَآءَ فِي الْمَحِيضِ</div><p>(...therefore, keep away from women during menses.) </p><p>Allah prohibited having sexual intercourse with the wife during menstruation, indicating that sexual intercourse is allowed otherwise. </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you.) indicates that men should have sexual intercourse with their wives after they take a bath. The scholars agree that the woman is obliged to take a bath, or to perform Tayammum with sand, if she is unable to use water, before she is allowed to have sexual intercourse with her husband, after the monthly period ends. Ibn `Abbas said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يَطْهُرْنَ</div><p>\"(till they are purified) means from blood, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ</div><p>(And when they have purified themselves) means with water.\" This is also the Tafsir of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Al-Layth bin Sa`d and others. </p><h2>Anal Sex is prohibited</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(...as Allah has ordained for you.) this refers to Al-Farj (the vagina), as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and other scholars have stated. Therefore, anal sex is prohibited, as we will further emphasize afterwards, Allah willing. Abu Razin, `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak and others said that: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(...then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you.) means when they are pure, and not during the menses.

The Jews said this and that, should we have sex with our women (meaning, during the menstruation period)\" The face of Allah's Messenger changed color, until the Companions thought that he was angry with them. They left. Soon after, some milk was brought to Allah's Messenger as a gift, and he sent some of it for them to drink. They knew then that Allah's Messenger was not angry with them.

Then, Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّى شِئْتُمْ</div><p>(Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will,)\" </p><p>This has an authentic chain of narrators. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Khatami narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَسْتَحْيِي اللهُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ ثَلَاثًا لَا تَأْتُوا النِّسَاءَ فِي أَعْجَازِهِن»</div><p>(Allah does not shy from the truth - he said it thrice-, do not have anal sex with women.) </p><p>This Hadith was collected by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. </p><p>Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i reported that Ibn `Abbas narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَنْظُرُ اللهُ إِلى رَجُلٍ أَتَى رَجُلًا أَوِ امْرَأَةً فِي الدُّبُر»</div><p>(Allah does not look at a man who had anal sex with another man or a woman.) </p><p>At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" This is also the narration that Ibn Hibban collected in his Sahih, while Ibn Hazm stated that this is an authentic Hadith. </p><p>In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that `Ali bin Talaq said, \"Allah's Messenger forbade anal sex with women, for Allah does not shy away from truth.\" Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi also reported this Hadith and said, \"Hasan\". </p><p>Abu Muhammad `Abdullah bin `Abdur-Rahman Darimi reported in his Musnad that Sa`id bin Yasar Abu Hubab said: I said to Ibn `Umar, \"What do you say about having sex with women in the rear\" He said, \"What does it mean\" I said, \"Anal sex.\" He said, \"Does a Muslim do that\" This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators and is an explicit rejection of anal sex from Ibn `Umar. </p><p>Abu Bakr bin Ziyad Naysaburi reported that Isma`il bin Ruh said that he asked Malik bin Anas, \"What do you say about having sex with women in the anus\" He said, \"You are not an Arab Does sex occur but in the place of pregnancy Do it only in the Farj (vagina).\" I said, \"O Abu `Abdullah! They say that you allow that practice.\" He said, \"They utter a lie about me, they lie about me.\" This is Malik's firm stance on this subject. It is also the view of Sa`id bin Musayyib, Abu Salamah, `Ikrimah, Tawus, `Ata , Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Mujahid bin Jabr, Al-Hasan and other scholars of the Salaf (the Companions and the following two generations after them). They all, along with the majority of the scholars, harshly rebuked the practice of anal sex and many of them called this practice a Kufr. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِّمُواْ لاًّنفُسِكُمْ</div><p>(. ..and send for your own selves beforehand.) meaning, by performing the acts of worship while refraining from whatever Allah has prohibited for you. This is why Allah said afterwards: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّكُم مُّلَـقُوهُ</div><p>(And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter),) </p><p>meaning, He will hold you accountable for all of your deeds, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(...and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad ).) meaning, those who obey what Allah has commanded and refrain from what He has prohibited. Ibn Jarir reported that `Ata' said, or related it to Ibn `Abbas, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدِّمُواْ لاًّنفُسِكُمْ</div><p>(...and send for your own selves beforehand.) means, mention Allah's Name, by saying, `Bismillah', before having sexual intercourse.\" Al-Bukhari also reported that Ibn `Abbas narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَهْلَهُ قَالَ: بِاسْمِ اللهِ، اللَّهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا، فَإنَّهُ إِنْ يُقَدَّرْ بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَدٌ فِي ذلِكَ، لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَبَدًا»</div><p>(If anyone of you on having sexual relations with his wife said: `In the Name of Allah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you bestow upon us (i.e., the coming offspring) from Satan,' and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm him.) </p>"

They all stated that he does not have to do anything until the four months have passed and then has to either retain or divorce her.\" Ad-Daraqutni also reported this from Suhayl. </p><p>It is also reported from `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali, Abu Ad-Darda', `A'ishah, Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbas. This is also the opinion of Sa`id bin Musayyib, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Mujahid, Tawus, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Al-Qasim. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The `Iddah (Waiting Period) of the Divorced Woman</h2><p>This Ayah contains a command from Allah that the divorced woman, whose marriage was consummated and who still has menstruation periods, should wait for three (menstrual) periods (Quru') after the divorce and then remarry if she wishes. </p><h2>The Meaning of Al-Quru</h2><p>Ibn Jarir related that `Alqamah said: We were with `Umar bin Al-Khattab when a woman came and said, \"My husband divorced me one or two periods ago. He then came back to me while I had prepared my water for taking a bath, took off my clothes and closed my door.\" `Umar asked `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, \"What do you think\" He said, \"I think that she is still his wife, as long as she is not allowed to resume praying (i.e., until the third period ends before he takes her back).\" `Umar said, \"This is my opinion too.\" This is also the opinion of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali, Abu Ad-Darda', `Ubadah bin As-Samit, Anas bin Malik, Ibn Mas`ud, Mu`adh, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari and Ibn `Abbas. Furthermore, this is the opinion of Sa`id bin Musayyib, `Alqamah, Aswad, Ibrahim, Mujahid, `Ata', Tawus, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Sirin, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi`, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi, Makhul, Ad-Dahhak and `Ata' Al-Khurasani. They all stated that the Quru' is the menstruation period. What testifies to this is the Hadith that Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i reported that Fatimah bint Abu Hubaiysh said that Allah's Messenger said to her: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعِي الصَّلاَةَ أَيَّامَ أَقْرَائِك»</div><p>(Do not pray during your Aqra' (pl. for Quru', the menstruation period).) </p><p>If this Hadith was authentic, it would have been a clear proof that the Quru' is the menstruation period. However, one of the narrators of this Hadith, Al-Mundhir, is an unknown person (in Hadith terminology), as Abu Hatim has stated, although Ibn Hibban has mentioned Al-Mundhir in his book Ath-Thiqat. </p><h2>A Woman's Statement about Menses and Purity is to be accepted</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِى أَرْحَامِهِنَّ</div><p>(...and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,) meaning, of pregnancy or menstruation periods. This is the Tafsir of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hakam bin `Utaybah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak and others. </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(...if they believe in Allah and the Last Day.) </p><p>This Ayah warns women against hiding the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), indicating that they are the authority in such matters as they alone know such facts about themselves. Since verifying such matters is difficult, Allah left this decision with them. Yet, women were warned not to hide the truth in case they wish to end the `Iddah sooner, or later, according to their desires. Women were thus commanded to say the truth (if they were pregnant or on their menses), no more and no less. </p><h2>The Husband has the Right to take back his Divorced Wife during the `Iddah (Waiting Period)</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُواْ إِصْلَـحاً</div><p>(And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation.) </p><p>Hence, the husband who divorces his wife can take her back, providing she is still in her `Iddah (time spent before a divorced woman or a widow can remarry) and that his aim, by taking her back, is righteous and for the purpose of bringing things back to normal. However, this ruling applies where the husband is eligible to take his divorced wife back. We should mention that (when this Ayah 2:228 was revealed), the ruling that made the divorce thrice and specified when the husband is ineligible to take his divorced wife back, had not been revealed yet. Previously, the man used to divorce his wife and then take her back even if he had divorced her a hundred separate times. Thereafter, Allah revealed the following Ayah (2:229) that made the divorce only thrice. So there was now a reversible divorce and an irreversible final divorce. </p><h2>The Rights the Spouses have over Each Other</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِى عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</div><p>(And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable,) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that the wife has certain rights on her husband, just as he has certain rights on her, and each is obliged to give the other spouse his due rights. Muslim reported that Jabir said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَاتَّقُوا اللهَ فِي النِّسَاءِ، فَإِنَّكُمْ أَخَذْتُمُوهُنَّ بِأَمَانَةِ اللهِ، وَاسْتَحْلَلْتُمْ فُرُوجَهُنَّ بِكَلِمَةِ اللهِ، وَلَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَنْ لَا يُوطِئْنَ فُرُشَكُمْ أَحَدًا تَكْرَهُونَهُ، فَإِنْ فَعَلْنَ ذَلِكَ فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ، وَلَهُنَّ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوف»</div><p>(Fear Allah regarding your women, for you have taken them by Allah's covenant and were allowed to enjoy with them sexually by Allah's Words. You have the right on them that they do not allow anyone you dislike to sit on your mat. If they do that, then discipline them leniently. They have the right to be spent on and to be bought clothes in what is reasonable.) </p><p>Bahz bin Hakim said that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri related that his grandfather said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What is the right the wife of one of us has\" The Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْ تُطْعِمَهَا إِذَا طَعِمْتَ، وتَكْسُوَهَا إِذَا اكْتَسَيْتَ، وَلَا تَضْرِبِ الْوَجْهَ، وَلَا تُقَبِّحْ، وَلَا تَهْجُرْ إِلَّا فِي الْبَيْت»</div><p>(To feed her when you eat, buy her clothes when you buy for yourself and to refrain from striking her on the face, cursing her or staying away from her except in the house.) </p><p>Waki` related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I like to take care of my appearance for my wife just as I like for her to take care of her appearance for me. This is because Allah says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ الَّذِى عَلَيْهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</div><p>(And they (women) have rights similar (to those of their husbands) over them to what is reasonable.)\" This statement is reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abu Hatim. </p><h2>The Virtue Men have over Women</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</div><p>(but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that men are in a more advantageous position than women physically as well as in their mannerism, status, obedience (of women to them), spending, taking care of the affairs and in general, in this life and in the Hereafter. Allah said (in another Ayah): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَلِهِمْ</div><p>(Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.) (4:34) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكُيمٌ</div><p>(And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) means, He is Mighty in His punishment of those who disobey and defy His commands. He is Wise in what He commands, destines and legislates. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Divorce is Thrice</h2><p>This honorable Ayah abrogated the previous practice in the beginning of Islam, when the man had the right to take back his divorced wife even if he had divorced her a hundred times, as long as she was still in her `Iddah (waiting period). This situation was harmful for the wife, and this is why Allah made the divorce thrice, where the husband is allowed to take back his wife after the first and the second divorce (as long as she is still in her `Iddah). The divorce becomes irrevocable after the third divorce, as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَـنٍ</div><p>(The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.) </p><p>In his Sunan, Abu Dawud reported in Chapter: \"Taking the Wife back after the third (Divorce) is an abrogated practice,\" that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُطَلَّقَـتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَـثَةَ قُرُوءٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِى أَرْحَامِهِنَّ</div><p>(And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,) (2:228) The man used to have the right to take back his wife even if he had divorced her thrice. Allah abrogated this and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ</div><p>(The divorce is twice.) </p><p>This Hadith was also collected by An-Nasa'i. Ibn Abu Hatim reported that `Urwah said that a man said to his wife, \"I will neither divorce you nor take you back.\" She said, \"How\" He said, \"I will divorce you and when your term of `Iddah nears its end, I will take you back.\" She went to Allah's Messenger and told him what happened, and Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ</div><p>(The divorce is twice.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) also reported this Hadith in his Tafsir. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَـنٍ</div><p>(...after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.) meaning, `If you divorce her once or twice, you have the choice to take her back, as long as she is still in her `Iddah, intending to be kind to her and to mend differences. Otherwise, await the end of her term of `Iddah, when the divorce becomes final, and let her go her own way in peace, without committing any harm or injustice against her.' `Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the man divorces his wife twice, let him fear Allah, regarding the third time. He should either keep her with him and treat her with kindness, or let her go her own way with kindness, without infringing upon any of her rights.\" </p><h2>Taking back the Mahr (Dowry)</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا</div><p>(And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of (the dowry) what you gave them,) meaning, you are not allowed to bother or pressure your wives to end this situation by giving you back the Mahr and any gifts that you have given them (in return for divorce). Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ</div><p>(...and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of what you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse.) (4:19) </p><p>However, if the wife willingly gives back anything with a good heart, then Allah said regarding this situation: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً</div><p>(...but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm.) (4:4) </p><h2>Allowing Khul` and the Return of the Mahr in that Case</h2><p>When the spouses have irreconcilable differences wherein the wife ignores the rights of the husband, dislikes him and becomes unable to live with him any longer, she is allowed to free herself (from married life) by giving him back what he had given her (in gifts and Mahr). There is no sin on her in this case nor on him if he accepts such offer. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ</div><p>(And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what you gave them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g., to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back.) </p><p>Sometimes, the woman has no valid reason and she still asks for her marriage to be ended. In this case, Ibn Jarir reported that Thawban said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُّمَا امْرَأَةٍ سَأَلَتْ زَوْجَهَا طَلَاقًا فِي غَيْرِ مَا بَأْسٍ، فَحَرَامٌ عَلَيْهَا رَائِحَةُ الْجَنَّـة»</div><p>(Any woman who asks her husband for divorce without justification, then the scent of Paradise will be forbidden for her.) </p><p>At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith and stated that it is Hasan. </p><p>Ibn Jarir said that the Ayah (2:229) was revealed about Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and his wife Habibah bint `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. In his Muwatta', Imam Malik reported that Habibah bint Sahl Al-Ansariyah was married to Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and that Allah's Messenger once went to the Fajr (Dawn) prayer and found Habibah bint Sahl by his door in the dark. Allah's Messenger said, \"Who is this\" She said, \"I am Habibah bint Sahl, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said, \"What is the matter\" She said, \"I and Thabit bin Qays\", meaning, (she can no longer be with) her husband. When her husband Thabit bin Qays came, Allah's Messenger said to him: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هذِهِ حَبِيبَةُ بِنْتُ سَهْلٍ قَدْ ذَكَرَتْ مَا شَاءَ اللهُ أَنْ تَذْكُر»</div><p>(This is Habibah bint Sahl, she said what Allah has permitted her to say.) </p><p>Habibah also said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I still have everything he gave me.\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خُذْ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Take it from her.) So, he took it from her and she remained in her family's house.\" </p><p>This was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasai. </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the wife of Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas came to the Prophet and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I do not criticize his religion or mannerism. But I hate committing Kufr in Islam (by ignoring his rights on her).\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَرُدِّينَ عَلَيهِ حَدِيقَتَه»</div><p>؟ </p><p>(Will you give him back his garden) </p><p>She said, \"Yes.\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اقْبَلِ الْحَدِيقَةَ وَطَلِّقْهَا تَطْلِيقَة»</div><p>(Take back the garden and divorce her once. ) </p><p>An-Nasa'i also recorded it. </p><h2>The `Iddah (Waiting Period) for the Khul\"</h2><p>At-Tirmidhi reported that Rubayi` bint Mu`awwidh bin `Afra' got a Khul` during the time of Allah's Messenger and the Prophet ordered her to wait for one menstruation period for `Iddah. </p><h2>Transgressing the set limits of Allah is an Injustice</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the wrongdoers.) </p><p>This means that the laws that Allah has legislated are His set limits, so do not transgress them. An authentic Hadith states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ حَدَّ حُدُودًا فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا، وفَرَضَ فَرَائِضَ فَلَا تُضَيِّعُوهَا، وحَرَّمَ مَحَارِمَ فَلَا تَنْتَهِكُوهَا، وَسَكَتَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ رَحْمَةً لَكُمْ مِنْ غَيْرِ نِسْيَانٍ فَلَا تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا»</div><p>(Allah has set some limits, so do not transgress them; and commanded some commands, so do not ignore them; and made some things unlawful, so do not commit them. He has also left some matters (without rulings) as a mercy with you, not because He has forgotten them, so do not ask about them.) </p><h2>Pronouncing Three Divorces at the same Time is Unlawful</h2><p>The last Ayah we mentioned was used as evidence to prove that it is not allowed to pronounce three divorces at one time. What further proves this ruling is that Mahmud bin Labid has stated - as An-Nasa'i recorded - that Allah's Messenger was told about a man who pronounced three divorces on his wife at one time, so the Prophet stood up while angry and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُلْعَبُ بِكِتَابِ اللهِ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُم»</div><p>؟ </p><p>(The Book of Allah is being made the subject of jest while I am still amongst you) </p><p>A man then stood up and said, \"Should I kill that man, O Messenger of Allah\" </p><h2>The Wife cannot be taken back after the Third Divorce</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ</div><p>(And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful for him thereafter until she has married another husband.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that if the man divorces his wife for the third time after he divorced her twice, then she will no longer be allowed for marriage to him. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ</div><p>(...until she has married another husband.) meaning, until she legally marries another man. For instance, if she has sexual intercourse with any man, even her master (if she was a servant), she would still be ineligible for marriage for her ex-husband (who divorced her thrice), because whomever she had sexual relations with was not her legal husband. If she marries a man without consummating the marriage, she will not be eligible for her ex-husband. Muslim reported that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger was asked about a woman who marries a man who thereafter divorces her (thrice). She then marries another man and he divorces her before he has sexual relations with her, would she be allowed for her first husband Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، حَتَّى يَذُوقَ عُسَيْلَتَهَا»</div><p>(No, until he enjoys her `Usaylah (sexual relation).) Al-Bukhari also reported this Hadith. </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The wife of Rifa`ah Al-Qurazi came while I and Abu Bakr were with the Prophet and she said, `I was Rifa`ah's wife, but he divorced me and it was an irrevocable divorce. Then I married `Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubayr, but his sexual organ is minute like a string.' She then took a small string of her garment (to resemble how small his sexual organ was). Khalid bin Sa`id bin Al-`As, who was next to the door and was not yet allowed in, said, `O Abu Bakr! Why do you not forbid this (woman) from what she is revealing frankly before the Prophet' The Prophet merely smiled. Then, Allah's Messenger asked her: c </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَأَنَّكِ تُرِيدِينَ أَنْ تَرْجِعِي إِلى رِفَاعَةَ، لَا، حَتَّى تَذُوقِي عُسَيْلَتَهُ، وَيَذُوقَ عُسَيْلَتَك»</div><p>(Do you want to remarry Rifa`ah You cannot unless you experience his `Usaylah and he experiences your `Usaylah (i.e., had a complete sexual relation with your present husband).)\" </p><p>Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Muslim's wording is \"Rifa`ah divorced his wife for the third and final time.\" </p><p>The word `Usaylah mentioned in the Hadith means sexual intercourse. Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i reported that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا إِنَّ الْعُسَيْلَةَ الْجِمَاع»</div><p>(`Usaylah is sexual intercourse.) </p><h2>The Curse on the Participants of Tahlil/Halalah</h2><p>The reason for the woman (who was divorced thrice) to marry another man must be that the man desires her and has the intention of having an extended married life with her. These are the legal goals and aims behind marriage. If the reason behind the second marriage was to make the woman eligible for her ex-husband again, then this is the Tahlil that the Hadiths have cursed and criticized. In addition, when the reason behind this marriage (if it was Tahlil) is announced in the contract, it would make the contract invalid according to the majority of the scholars. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Allah's Messenger cursed the one who does Tahlil, the one in whose favor it is done, those who eat Riba (usury) and those who feed it (pay the usury).\" At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i reported this Hadith and At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan.\" He said, \"This is what is acted upon according to people of knowledge among the Companions, among whom are `Umar, `Uthman and Ibn `Umar. It was also the saying of the scholars of Fiqh among the Tabi`in (second generation of Islam). And it has been reported from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas\". </p><p>In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim reported that Nafi` said: \"A man came to Ibn `Umar and asked him about a man who divorced his wife three times. Then, his brother married her to make Tahlil for his brother, without the brother knowing this fact. He then asked, \"Is she allowed for the first (husband)\" He said, \"No, unless it is a marriage that involves desire. We used to consider this an act of adultery during the time of Allah's Messenger .\" Al-Hakim said, \"This Hadith has a Sahih chain although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\"The wording of this Hadith indicates that the ruling came from the Prophet . Abu Bakr bin Abu Shaybah, Al-Jawzjani, Harb Al-Kirmani and Abu Bakr Al-Athram said that Qabisah bin Jabir said that `Umar said, \"If the participants to Tahlil are brought to me, I will have them stoned.\" </p><h2>When does a Woman who was divorced Three Times become Eligible for Her First Husband</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا</div><p>(And if he has divorced her) meaning, the second husband after he had complete sexual relations with her, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ</div><p>(it is no sin on both of them that they reunite) meaning, the wife and her first husband, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah.) meaning, they live together honorably. Mujahid said, \"If they are convinced that the aim behind their marriage is honorable.\" Next, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(These are the limits of Allah,) His commandments and legislation, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُبَيِّنُهَا</div><p>(He makes plain) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(for the people who have knowledge.) </p>"

The divorce becomes irrevocable after the third divorce, as Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَـنٍ</div><p>(The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.) </p><p>In his Sunan, Abu Dawud reported in Chapter: \"Taking the Wife back after the third (Divorce) is an abrogated practice,\" that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُطَلَّقَـتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَـثَةَ قُرُوءٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ اللَّهُ فِى أَرْحَامِهِنَّ</div><p>(And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,) (2:228) The man used to have the right to take back his wife even if he had divorced her thrice. Allah abrogated this and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ</div><p>(The divorce is twice.) </p><p>This Hadith was also collected by An-Nasa'i. Ibn Abu Hatim reported that `Urwah said that a man said to his wife, \"I will neither divorce you nor take you back.\" She said, \"How\" He said, \"I will divorce you and when your term of `Iddah nears its end, I will take you back.\" She went to Allah's Messenger and told him what happened, and Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الطَّلَـقُ مَرَّتَانِ</div><p>(The divorce is twice.) </p><p>Ibn Jarir (At-Tabari) also reported this Hadith in his Tafsir. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَـنٍ</div><p>(...after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.) meaning, `If you divorce her once or twice, you have the choice to take her back, as long as she is still in her `Iddah, intending to be kind to her and to mend differences. Otherwise, await the end of her term of `Iddah, when the divorce becomes final, and let her go her own way in peace, without committing any harm or injustice against her.' `Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the man divorces his wife twice, let him fear Allah, regarding the third time. He should either keep her with him and treat her with kindness, or let her go her own way with kindness, without infringing upon any of her rights.\" </p><h2>Taking back the Mahr (Dowry)</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا</div><p>(And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of (the dowry) what you gave them,) meaning, you are not allowed to bother or pressure your wives to end this situation by giving you back the Mahr and any gifts that you have given them (in return for divorce). Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ</div><p>(...and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of what you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse.) (4:19) </p><p>However, if the wife willingly gives back anything with a good heart, then Allah said regarding this situation: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً</div><p>(...but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm.) (4:4) </p><h2>Allowing Khul` and the Return of the Mahr in that Case</h2><p>When the spouses have irreconcilable differences wherein the wife ignores the rights of the husband, dislikes him and becomes unable to live with him any longer, she is allowed to free herself (from married life) by giving him back what he had given her (in gifts and Mahr). There is no sin on her in this case nor on him if he accepts such offer. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ</div><p>(And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what you gave them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g., to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back.) </p><p>Sometimes, the woman has no valid reason and she still asks for her marriage to be ended. In this case, Ibn Jarir reported that Thawban said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُّمَا امْرَأَةٍ سَأَلَتْ زَوْجَهَا طَلَاقًا فِي غَيْرِ مَا بَأْسٍ، فَحَرَامٌ عَلَيْهَا رَائِحَةُ الْجَنَّـة»</div><p>(Any woman who asks her husband for divorce without justification, then the scent of Paradise will be forbidden for her.) </p><p>At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith and stated that it is Hasan. </p><p>Ibn Jarir said that the Ayah (2:229) was revealed about Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and his wife Habibah bint `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul. In his Muwatta', Imam Malik reported that Habibah bint Sahl Al-Ansariyah was married to Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas and that Allah's Messenger once went to the Fajr (Dawn) prayer and found Habibah bint Sahl by his door in the dark. Allah's Messenger said, \"Who is this\" She said, \"I am Habibah bint Sahl, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said, \"What is the matter\" She said, \"I and Thabit bin Qays\", meaning, (she can no longer be with) her husband. When her husband Thabit bin Qays came, Allah's Messenger said to him: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هذِهِ حَبِيبَةُ بِنْتُ سَهْلٍ قَدْ ذَكَرَتْ مَا شَاءَ اللهُ أَنْ تَذْكُر»</div><p>(This is Habibah bint Sahl, she said what Allah has permitted her to say.) </p><p>Habibah also said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I still have everything he gave me.\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خُذْ مِنْهَا»</div><p>(Take it from her.) So, he took it from her and she remained in her family's house.\" </p><p>This was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasai. </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the wife of Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas came to the Prophet and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I do not criticize his religion or mannerism. But I hate committing Kufr in Islam (by ignoring his rights on her).\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَتَرُدِّينَ عَلَيهِ حَدِيقَتَه»</div><p>؟ </p><p>(Will you give him back his garden) </p><p>She said, \"Yes.\" Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اقْبَلِ الْحَدِيقَةَ وَطَلِّقْهَا تَطْلِيقَة»</div><p>(Take back the garden and divorce her once. ) </p><p>An-Nasa'i also recorded it. </p><h2>The `Iddah (Waiting Period) for the Khul\"</h2><p>At-Tirmidhi reported that Rubayi` bint Mu`awwidh bin `Afra' got a Khul` during the time of Allah's Messenger and the Prophet ordered her to wait for one menstruation period for `Iddah. </p><h2>Transgressing the set limits of Allah is an Injustice</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the wrongdoers.) </p><p>This means that the laws that Allah has legislated are His set limits, so do not transgress them. An authentic Hadith states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ حَدَّ حُدُودًا فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا، وفَرَضَ فَرَائِضَ فَلَا تُضَيِّعُوهَا، وحَرَّمَ مَحَارِمَ فَلَا تَنْتَهِكُوهَا، وَسَكَتَ عَنْ أَشْيَاءَ رَحْمَةً لَكُمْ مِنْ غَيْرِ نِسْيَانٍ فَلَا تَسْأَلُوا عَنْهَا»</div><p>(Allah has set some limits, so do not transgress them; and commanded some commands, so do not ignore them; and made some things unlawful, so do not commit them. He has also left some matters (without rulings) as a mercy with you, not because He has forgotten them, so do not ask about them.) </p><h2>Pronouncing Three Divorces at the same Time is Unlawful</h2><p>The last Ayah we mentioned was used as evidence to prove that it is not allowed to pronounce three divorces at one time. What further proves this ruling is that Mahmud bin Labid has stated - as An-Nasa'i recorded - that Allah's Messenger was told about a man who pronounced three divorces on his wife at one time, so the Prophet stood up while angry and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَيُلْعَبُ بِكِتَابِ اللهِ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُم»</div><p>؟ </p><p>(The Book of Allah is being made the subject of jest while I am still amongst you) </p><p>A man then stood up and said, \"Should I kill that man, O Messenger of Allah\" </p><h2>The Wife cannot be taken back after the Third Divorce</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ</div><p>(And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful for him thereafter until she has married another husband.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that if the man divorces his wife for the third time after he divorced her twice, then she will no longer be allowed for marriage to him. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ</div><p>(...until she has married another husband.) meaning, until she legally marries another man. For instance, if she has sexual intercourse with any man, even her master (if she was a servant), she would still be ineligible for marriage for her ex-husband (who divorced her thrice), because whomever she had sexual relations with was not her legal husband. If she marries a man without consummating the marriage, she will not be eligible for her ex-husband. Muslim reported that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger was asked about a woman who marries a man who thereafter divorces her (thrice). She then marries another man and he divorces her before he has sexual relations with her, would she be allowed for her first husband Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا، حَتَّى يَذُوقَ عُسَيْلَتَهَا»</div><p>(No, until he enjoys her `Usaylah (sexual relation).) Al-Bukhari also reported this Hadith. </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The wife of Rifa`ah Al-Qurazi came while I and Abu Bakr were with the Prophet and she said, `I was Rifa`ah's wife, but he divorced me and it was an irrevocable divorce. Then I married `Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubayr, but his sexual organ is minute like a string.' She then took a small string of her garment (to resemble how small his sexual organ was). Khalid bin Sa`id bin Al-`As, who was next to the door and was not yet allowed in, said, `O Abu Bakr! Why do you not forbid this (woman) from what she is revealing frankly before the Prophet' The Prophet merely smiled. Then, Allah's Messenger asked her: c </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَأَنَّكِ تُرِيدِينَ أَنْ تَرْجِعِي إِلى رِفَاعَةَ، لَا، حَتَّى تَذُوقِي عُسَيْلَتَهُ، وَيَذُوقَ عُسَيْلَتَك»</div><p>(Do you want to remarry Rifa`ah You cannot unless you experience his `Usaylah and he experiences your `Usaylah (i.e., had a complete sexual relation with your present husband).)\" </p><p>Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Muslim's wording is \"Rifa`ah divorced his wife for the third and final time.\" </p><p>The word `Usaylah mentioned in the Hadith means sexual intercourse. Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i reported that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَا إِنَّ الْعُسَيْلَةَ الْجِمَاع»</div><p>(`Usaylah is sexual intercourse.) </p><h2>The Curse on the Participants of Tahlil/Halalah</h2><p>The reason for the woman (who was divorced thrice) to marry another man must be that the man desires her and has the intention of having an extended married life with her. These are the legal goals and aims behind marriage. If the reason behind the second marriage was to make the woman eligible for her ex-husband again, then this is the Tahlil that the Hadiths have cursed and criticized. In addition, when the reason behind this marriage (if it was Tahlil) is announced in the contract, it would make the contract invalid according to the majority of the scholars. </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Allah's Messenger cursed the one who does Tahlil, the one in whose favor it is done, those who eat Riba (usury) and those who feed it (pay the usury).\" At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i reported this Hadith and At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan.\" He said, \"This is what is acted upon according to people of knowledge among the Companions, among whom are `Umar, `Uthman and Ibn `Umar. It was also the saying of the scholars of Fiqh among the Tabi`in (second generation of Islam). And it has been reported from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas\". </p><p>In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim reported that Nafi` said: \"A man came to Ibn `Umar and asked him about a man who divorced his wife three times. Then, his brother married her to make Tahlil for his brother, without the brother knowing this fact. He then asked, \"Is she allowed for the first (husband)\" He said, \"No, unless it is a marriage that involves desire. We used to consider this an act of adultery during the time of Allah's Messenger .\" Al-Hakim said, \"This Hadith has a Sahih chain although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\"The wording of this Hadith indicates that the ruling came from the Prophet . Abu Bakr bin Abu Shaybah, Al-Jawzjani, Harb Al-Kirmani and Abu Bakr Al-Athram said that Qabisah bin Jabir said that `Umar said, \"If the participants to Tahlil are brought to me, I will have them stoned.\" </p><h2>When does a Woman who was divorced Three Times become Eligible for Her First Husband</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا</div><p>(And if he has divorced her) meaning, the second husband after he had complete sexual relations with her, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ</div><p>(it is no sin on both of them that they reunite) meaning, the wife and her first husband, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah.) meaning, they live together honorably. Mujahid said, \"If they are convinced that the aim behind their marriage is honorable.\" Next, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ</div><p>(These are the limits of Allah,) His commandments and legislation, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُبَيِّنُهَا</div><p>(He makes plain) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(for the people who have knowledge.) </p>"

      "text": "<h2>Being Kind to the Divorced Wife</h2><p>This is a command from Allah to men that when one of them divorces his wife with a reversible divorce, he should treat her kindly. So when her term of `Iddah (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her `Iddah finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لِّتَعْتَدُواْ</div><p>(But do not take them back to hurt them,) </p><p>Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that a man used to divorce his wife, and when her `Iddah came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her `Iddah and when her `Iddah term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of `Iddah would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ</div><p>(...and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself.) meaning, by defying Allah's commandments. Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ آيَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُوًا</div><p>(And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest,) </p><p>Ibn Jarir said that Abu Musa (Al-Ash`ari) narrated that Allah's Messenger once became angry at the Ash`ari tribe. Abu Musa went to him and said, \"O Messenger of Allah!

This is not the appropriate way Muslims conduct divorce. Divorce the woman when she has fulfilled the term of the prescribed period.) </p><p>Masruq said that the Ayah refers to the man who harms his wife by divorcing her and then taking her back, so that the `Iddah term is prolonged for her. Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"He is the man who divorces his wife and says, `I was joking.' Or he frees a servant or gets married and says, `I was only joking.'

He later thinks about taking her back in marriage and the woman also wishes that, yet, her family prevents her from remarrying him. Hence, Allah prohibited her family from preventing her.\" Masruq, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Az-Zuhri and Ad-Dahhak stated that this is the reason behind revealing the Ayah (2:232). These statements clearly conform to the apparent meaning of the Ayah. </p><h2>There is no Marriage without a Wali (for the Woman)</h2><p>The Ayah (2:232) also indicates that the woman is not permitted to give herself in marriage. Rather, she requires a Wali (guardian such as her father, brother, adult son, and so forth) to give her away in marriage, as Ibn Jarir and At-Tirmidhi have stated when they mentioned this Ayah. Also, a Hadith states that: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُزَوِّجُ الْمَرْأةُ الْمَرْأَةَ، ولَا تُزَوِّج الْمَرأةُ نَفْسَهَا، فَإِنَّ الزَّانِيَةَ هِيَ الَّتِي تُزَوِّجُ نَفْسَهَا»</div><p>(The woman does not give another woman away for marriage and the woman does not give herself away in marriage, for only the adulteress gives herself away for marriage.) </p><p>Another Hadith states: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا نِكَاحَ إلَّا بِوَلِيَ مُرْشِدٍ وَشَاهِدَيْ عَدْل»</div><p>(No marriage is valid except with the participation of a mature Wali and two trustworthy witnesses.) </p><h2>The Reason behind revealing the Ayah (2:232)</h2><p>It was reported that this Ayah was revealed about Ma`qil bin Yasar Al-Muzani and his sister. Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih, when he mentioned the Tafsir of this Ayah (2:232), that the husband of the sister of Ma`qil bin Yasar divorced her. He waited until her `Iddah finished and then asked to remarry her, but Ma`qil refused. Then, this Ayah was sent down: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَن يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَجَهُنَّ</div><p>(...do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.) </p><p>Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah and Al-Bayhaqi reported this Hadith from Al-Hasan from Ma`qil bin Yasar.

She remained with him for a while and he divorced her once and did not take her back until her `Iddah finished. They then wanted to get back with each other and he came to ask her for marriage. Ma`qil said to him, \"O ungrateful one! I honored you and married her to you but you divorced her. By Allah! She will never be returned to you.\" But Allah knew his need for his wife and her need for her husband and He revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ</div><p>(And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, ) until He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(...and you know not.) </p><p>When Ma`qil heard the Ayah, he said, \"I hear and obey my Lord.\" He then summoned the man and said, \"I will honor you and let you remarry (my sister).\" Ibn Marduwyah added (that Ma`qil said), \"And will pay (the expiation) for breaking my vow.\" </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ مِنكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(This (instruction) is an admonition for him among you who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) meaning, prohibiting you from preventing the women from marrying their ex-husbands, if they both agree to it, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن كَانَ مِنكُمْ</div><p>(among you) O people, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) meaning, believes in Allah's commandments and fears His warnings and the torment in the Hereafter.

The majority of the people of knowledge among the Companions of Allah's Messenger and others acted upon this, that is that suckling establishes Tahrim (prohibition in marriage) before the end of the two years and that whatever occurs after that does not establish Tahrim\". At-Tirmidhi is alone in recording this Hadith and the narrators in its chain meet the criteria of the Sahihayn. The Prophet's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِلَّا مَا كَانَ فِي الثَّدْي»</div><p>(On the breast) refers to the organ of suckling before the two years. Imam Ahmad reported a Hadith in which Al-Bara' bin `Azib narrated, \"When Ibrahim, the Prophet's son, died, the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ ابْنِي مَاتَ فِي الثَّدْيِ، إِنَّ لَهُ مُرْضِعًا فِي الْجَنَّـة»</div><p>(My son has died on the breast and he has someone to suckle him in Paradise.) </p><p>Furthermore, Ad-Daraqutni related that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحْرُمُ مِنَ الرَّضَاعِ إِلَّا مَا كَانَ فِي الْحَوْلَيْن»</div><p>(Suckling establishes Tahrim only within the (first) two years.) </p><p>Imam Malik reported this Hadith from Thawr bin Zayd who narrated that Ibn `Abbas related it to the Prophet . Ad-Darawardi reported this Hadith from Thawr who narrated it from `Ikrimah who narrated it from Ibn `Abbas. In this narration, which is more authentic, he added: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَمَا كَانَ بَعْدَ الْحَوْلَيْنِ فَليْسَ بِشَيْء»</div><p>(Whatever occurs after the two years is not considered.) </p><h2>Suckling beyond the Two Years</h2><p>It is reported in the Sahih that `A'ishah thought that if a woman gives her milk to an older person (meaning beyond the age of two years) then this will establish Tahrim. This is also the opinion of `Ata' bin Abu Rabah and Layth bin Sa`d. Hence, `A'ishah thought that it is permissible to suckle the man whom the woman needs to be allowed in her house. She used as evidence the Hadith of Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah, where the Prophet ordered Abu Hudhayfah's wife to give some of her milk to Salim, although he was a man, and ever since then, he used to enter her house freely. However, the rest of the Prophet's wives did not agree with this opinion and thought that this was only a special case. This is also the opinion of the majority of the scholars. </p><h2>Suckling for Monetary Compensation</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</div><p>(...but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother's food and clothing on a reasonable basis.) meaning, the father of the baby is obliged to provide for the expenses of the mother and to buy her clothes, in reasonable amounts usually used by similar women in that area, without extravagance or stinginess. The father spends within his means in this case. Allah said in another Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً </div><p>(Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) (65:7) </p><p>Ad-Dahhak commented, \"If the husband divorces his wife, with whom he had a child, and she suckles that child, he is required to provide for the mother's expenses and clothes within reason.\" </p><h2>No Darar (Harm) or Dirar (Revenge)</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا</div><p>(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child,) meaning, the mother should not decline to rear her child to harm its father. The mother does not have the right to refrain from suckling the child after giving birth, unless she suckles him/her the milk that is necessary for his/her survival. Later on, she is allowed to give up custody of the child as long as she does not do that intending to harm the father. In addition, the father is not allowed to take the child from his mother to harm the mother. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ</div><p>(...nor father on account of his child.) meaning, by taking the child from its mother intending to harm the mother. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and Ibn Zayd, and others on this Ayah. </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذلِكَ</div><p>(And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father).) meaning, by refraining from harming the relative (of the father, i.e., his infant), as Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi and Ad-Dahhak stated. It was also reported that (the Ayah requires) the inheritor (of the father) to spend on the mother of the child, just as the father was spending, and to preserve her rights and refrain from harming her, according to the Tafsir of the majority of the scholars. We should state that Ibn Jarir has explained this subject in detail in his Tafsir and that he also stated that suckling the child after the second year might harm the child's body and mind. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that `Alqamah asked a woman who was suckling her child after the second year ended, not to do that. </p><h2>Fitam (weaning) occurs by Mutual Consent</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالاً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا</div><p>(If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that if the father and the mother decide on the Fitam (weaning) before the two years (of suckling) end, and for a benefit that they duly discuss and agree upon, then there is no sin in this case. So, the Ayah indicates that one parent is not allowed to make this kind of decision without duly consulting the other parent, as stated by Ath-Thawri. The method of mutual consultation protects the child's interests. It is also a mercy from Allah to His servants, for He has legislated the best method for parents to rear their children, and His legislation guides and directs the parents and the children to success. Similarly, Allah said in Surat At-Talaq (chapter 65 in the Qur'an): </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى</div><p>(Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you accept the advice of the other in a just way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may give suck for him (the father of the child).) (65:6) </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُواْ أَوْلَـدَكُمْ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّآ ءَاتَيْتُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</div><p>(And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on a reasonable basis.) meaning, if the mother and the father both agree that the father assumes custody of the child due to a circumstance that compels her or allows him to do so, then there is no sin in this case. Hence, the mother is allowed to give up the child and the father is allowed to assume custody of the child. The father should kindly give the mother her expenses for the previous period (during which she reared and suckled the child), and he should seek other women to suckle his child for monetary compensation. Thereafter, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(And fear Allah) meaning, in all of your affairs, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</div><p>(And know that Allah is All-Seer of what you do.) meaning, none of your affairs or speech escapes His perfect Watch. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The `Iddah (Waiting Period) of the Widow</h2><p>This Ayah contains a command from Allah to the wives whose husbands die, that they should observe a period of `Iddah of four months and ten nights, including the cases where the marriage was consummated or otherwise, according to the consensus (of the scholars). </p><p>The proof that this ruling includes the case where the marriage was not consummated is included in the general meaning of the Ayah. In a narration recorded by Imam Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, which At-Tirmidhi graded Sahih, Ibn Mas`ud was asked about a man who married a woman, but he died before consummating the marriage. He also did not appoint a Mahr (dowry) for her. They kept asking Ibn Mas`ud about this subject until he said, \"I shall give you my own opinion, and if it is correct then it is from Allah, while if it is wrong it is because of my error and because of (the evil efforts of) Satan. In this case, Allah and His Messenger are innocent of my opinion. She has her full Mahr.\" In another narration, Ibn Mas`ud said, \"She has a similar Mahr to that of the women of her status, without stinginess or extravagance.\" He then continued, \"She has to spend the `Iddah and has a right to the inheritance.\" Ma`qil bin Yasar Ashja`i then stood up and said, \"I heard Allah's Messenger issue a similar judgment for the benefit of Barwa` bint Washiq.\" `Abdullah bin Mas`ud became very delighted upon hearing this statement. In another narration, several men from Ashja` (tribe) stood up and said, \"We testify that Allah's Messenger issued a similar ruling for the benefit of Barwa` bint Washiq.\" </p><p>As for the case of the widow whose husband dies while she is pregnant, her term of `Iddah ends when she gives birth, even if it occurs an instant (after her husband dies). This ruling is taken from Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ</div><p>(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) (65:4) </p><p>There is also a Hadith from Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyah in the Two Sahihs, through various chains of narration. Her husband, Sa`d bin Khawlah, died while she was pregnant and she gave birth only a few nights after his death. When she finished her Nifas (postnatal period), she beautified herself for those who might seek to engage her (for marriage). Then, Abu Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, \"Why do I see you beautified yourself, do you wish to marry By Allah! You will not marry until the four months and ten nights have passed.\" Subay`ah said, \"When he said that to me, I collected my garments when night fell and went to Allah's Messenger and asked him about this matter. He said that my `Iddah had finished when I gave birth and allowed me to get married if I wished.\" </p><h2>The Wisdom behind legislating the `Iddah</h2><p>Sa`id bin Musayyib and Abu Al-`Aliyah stated that the wisdom behind making the `Iddah of the widow four months and ten nights is that the womb might contain a fetus. When the woman waits for this period, it will become evident if she is pregnant. Similarly, there is a Hadith in the Two Sahihs narrated by Ibn Mas`ud stating: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ يَوْمًا نُطْفَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذلِكَ، ثُمَّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكُ فَيَنْفُخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»</div><p>((The creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of his mother in forty days in the form of a seed, and next he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and next a morsel of flesh for a similar period. Then, Allah sends an angel who is ordered to breathe life unto the fetus.) </p><p>So, these are four months and ten more days to be sure, as some months are less (than thirty days), and the fetus will then start to show signs of life after the soul has been breathed into it. Allah knows best. </p><h2>The `Iddah of the Slave Mother whose Master dies</h2><p>We should state here that the `Iddah of the slave mother is the same in the case of death, as the `Iddah of the free woman. Imam Ahmad reported that `Amr bin Al-`As said, \"Do not confuse the Sunnah of our Prophet for us. The `Iddah of the mother, who is also a servant, when her master dies, is four months and ten nights.\" </p><h2>Mourning is required during the `Iddah of Death</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِى أَنفُسِهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</div><p>(...then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no sin on you if they (the wives) dispose of themselves in a (just and) honorable manner (i.e., they can marry). And Allah is well-acquainted with what you do.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that mourning for the dead husband is required until the `Iddah is finished. It is also reported in the Two Sahihs that Umm Habibah and Zaynab bint Jahsh narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَحِلُّ لِامْرَأَةٍ تُؤْمِنُ بِاللهِ وَالْيَوْم الآخِر أن تُحِدَّ عَلى مَيِتٍ فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، إِلَّا عَلى زَوْجٍ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا»</div><p>(It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for any dead person except her husband, for whom she mourns for four months and ten days.) </p><p>It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Umm Salamah said that a woman said, \"O Messenger of Allah! My daughter's husband died and she is complaining about her eye, should we administer kohl in her eye\" He said, \"No,\" several times upon repeating this question. He then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إنَّمَا هِيَ أَرْبَعَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرٌ، وَقَدْ كَانَتْ إِحْدَاكُنَّ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ تَمْكُثُ سَنَة»</div><p>(It is four months and ten (nights)! During the Jahiliyyah, one of you would mourn for an entire year.) </p><p>Zaiynab the daughter of Umm Salamah said (about the pre-Islamic era of ignorance), \"When the woman's husband died, she would go into seclusion and would wear the worst clothes she has. She would refrain from wearing perfume or any adornments until a year passed. She would then come out of seclusion and would be given dung that she would throw. Then an animal would be brought out, a donkey, a sheep, or a bird. Then some blood would be drained from it, usually resulting in its death.\" </p><p>In short, the mourning required from a wife whose husband dies, includes not using beautification aids, such as wearing perfume and the clothes and jewelry that encourage the men to seek marriage from the woman. All widows must observe this period of mourning whether they are young, old, free, servant, Muslim or disbeliever, as the general meaning of the Ayah indicates. </p><p>Allah also said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ</div><p>(...then when they have fulfilled their term) meaning, when the `Iddah finishes, according to Ad-Dahhak and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(there is no sin on you) Az-Zuhri said, \"Meaning her Wali (guardian).\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ</div><p>(if they (the wives) dispose) meaning, the women whose `Iddah has finished. Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If the woman is divorced or if her husband dies and then her `Iddah term ends, there is no sin that she beautifies herself, so that she becomes ready for marriage proposals. This is the way `that is just and honorable'.\" It was reported that Muqatil bin Hayyan gave the same explanation. Ibn Jurayj related that Mujahid said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِى أَنفُسِهِنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</div><p>(...there is no sin on you if they (the wives) dispose of themselves in a just and honorable manner.) \"refers to allowed and pure (honorable) marriage.\" It was also reported that Al-Hasan, Az-Zuhri and As-Suddi said the same. </p>"

It is also allowed to indirectly mention marriage to a woman who had gone through final, irrevocable divorce. The Prophet ordered Fatimah bint Qays to remain in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum for `Iddah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her for the third time. He said to her: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِذَا حَلَلْتِ فَآذِنِينِي»</div><p>(Inform me when your `Iddah term ends.) </p><p>When she finished the `Iddah, Usamah bin Zayd, the Prophet's freed slave asked to marry her, and the Prophet married her to him. As for the divorced wife (not irrevocably divorced), there is no disagreement that it is not allowed for other than her husband to mention marriage proposals to her directly or indirectly (before the `Iddah finishes). Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ</div><p>(...or conceal it in yourself,) meaning, if you hide the intention of seeking marriage with them.

As-Suddi said that Abu Salih mentioned that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إَّلا أَن يَعْفُونَ</div><p>(unless they (the women) agree to remit it,) \"Unless the wife forfeits her right.\"Furthermore, Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abu Hatim said that it was reported that Shurayh, Sa`id bin Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Nafi`, Qatadah, Jabir bin Zayd, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ibn Sirin, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi said similarly. </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يَعْفُوَاْ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ النِّكَاحِ</div><p>(...or he (the husband), in whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to remit it.) </p><p>Ibn Abu Hatim reported that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his grandfather narrated that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَلِيُّ عُقْدَةِ النِّكَاحِ الزَّوْج»</div><p>(The husband is he who has the marriage tie.) </p><p>Ibn Marduwyah also reported this Hadith, and it is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. The Hadith states that the husband is the person who really holds the marriage tie in his hand, as it is up to him to go on with the marriage or end it. On the other hand, the Wali of the wife is not allowed to give away any of her rightful dues without her permission, especially the dowry. </p><p>Allah then stated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن تَعْفُواْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</div><p>(And to remit it is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) </p><p>Ibn Jarir said, \"Some scholars said that this statement is directed at both men and women.\" Ibn `Abbas said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن تَعْفُواْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</div><p>(And to remit it is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).) indicates that the one who forgives, is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety).\" A similar statement was made by Ash-Sha`bi and several other scholars. </p><p>Mujahid, An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Thawri stated that `liberality' mentioned in the Ayah refers to the woman giving away her half Mahr, or the man giving away the full Mahr. This is why Allah said here: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَنسَوُاْ الْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ</div><p>(And do not forget liberality between yourselves.) meaning, kindness (or generosity), as Sa`id has stated. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</div><p>(Truly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do.) meaning, none of your affairs ever escapes His perfect Watch, and He will reward each according to his deeds. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَـفِظُواْ عَلَى الصَّلَوَتِ والصَّلَوةِ الْوُسْطَى وَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ قَـنِتِينَ </div>"

Al-Qadi Al-Mawardi added that the majority of the scholars of the Tabi`in also held this view. Al-Hafiz Abu `Umar bin `Abdul-Barr said that this is also the opinion of the majority of the scholars of the Athar (i.e., the Hadith and the statements of the Salaf). In addition, Abu Muhammad bin `Atiyah said that this is the Tafsir (of the Middle prayer) of the majority of scholars. Al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad `Abdul-Mu'min bin Khalaf Ad-Dumyati stated in his book on the Middle prayer that it is the `Asr prayer and mentioned that this is the Tafsir of `Umar, `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Abu Ayyub, `Abdullah bin `Amr, Samurah bin Jundub, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa`id, Hafsah, Umm Habibah, Umm Salamah, Ibn `Abbas and `A'ishah.

Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. In addition, the Two Shaykhs, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i and several other collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith using different chains of narrators to `Ali. The Hadith about the battle of Al-Ahzab, when the Mushriks prevented Allah's Messenger and his Companions from performing the `Asr prayer, has been narrated by several other Companions. We only mentioned the narrations that stated that the Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer. Furthermore, Muslim reported similar wordings for this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud and Al-Bara' bin `Azib. </p><p>In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that Samurah bin Jundub said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْر»</div><p>(The Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer.) </p><p>In another narration, Allah's Messenger mentioned: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَـفِظُواْ عَلَى الصَّلَوَتِ والصَّلَوةِ الْوُسْطَى</div><p>(Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the Middle Salah) and stated that it is the `Asr prayer. In another narration, Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«هِيَ الْعَصْر»</div><p>(It is the `Asr prayer.) and Ibn Ja`far mentioned that the Prophet was then being asked about the Middle prayer. At-Tirmidhi reported this Hadith and said, \"Hasan, Sahih.\" In addition, Abu Hatim bin Hibban reported in his Sahih that `Abdullah said that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْر»</div><p>(The Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer.) </p><p>At-Tirmidhi reported that Ibn Mas`ud narrated that Allah's Messenger said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْر»</div><p>(The `Asr prayer is the Middle prayer.) </p><p>At-Tirmidhi then stated that this Hadith is of a Hasan, Sahih type.

What further proves this fact is that, in an authentic Hadith, Allah's Messenger emphasized the necessity of preserving the `Asr prayer, when he said, as Ibn `Umar narrated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ فَاتَتْهُ صَلَاةُ الْعَصْرِ فَكَأَنَّمَا وُتِرَ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَه»</div><p>(Whoever misses the `Asr prayer will be like who has lost his family and money.) </p><p>It is reported in the Sahih that Buraydah bin Al-Husayb said that the Prophet said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بَكِّرُوا بِالصَّلَاةِ فِي يَوْمِ الْغَيْمِ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ تَرَكَ صَلَاةَ الْعَصْرِ، فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُه»</div><p>(On a cloudy day, perform the (`Asr) prayer early, for whoever misses the `Asr prayer, will have his (good) deeds annulled.) </p><h2>The Prohibition of speaking during the Prayer</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ قَـنِتِينَ</div><p>(And stand before Allah with obedience.) meaning, with humbleness and humility before Him (i.e., during the prayer). This command indicates that it is not allowed to speak during the prayer, as speaking contradicts the nature of the prayer. This is why the Prophet refused to answer Ibn Mas`ud when he greeted him while he was praying and said afterwards: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الصَّلَاةِ لَشُغْلًا»</div><p>(The prayer makes one sufficiently busy.) (i.e., by the various actions of the body, tongue and heart involved during the prayer.) </p><p>Muslim reported that the Prophet said to Mu`awiyah bin Hakam As-Sulami when he spoke during the prayer: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ هذِهِ الصَّلَاةَ لَا يَصْلُحُ فِيهَا شَيْءٌ مِنْ كَلَامِ النَّاسِ، إنَّمَا هِي التَّسْبِيحُ وَالتَّكْبِيرُ وَذِكْرُ الله»</div><p>(The ordinary speech people indulge in is not appropriate during the prayer. The prayer involves only Tasbih (praising Allah), Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar, i.e., Allah is the Most Great) and remembering Allah.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Zayd bin Arqam said, \"One used to address his friend about various affairs during the prayer. Then when this Ayah was revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ قَـنِتِينَ</div><p>(And stand before Allah with obedience.) we were ordered to refrain from speaking.\" The Group (i. e., the Hadith collections), except Ibn Majah, reported this Hadith. </p><h2>The Fear Prayer</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالاً أَوْ رُكْبَانًا فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And if you fear (an enemy), (perform Salah) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, then remember Allah (pray) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).) </p><p>After Allah commanded His servants to perform the prayer perfectly and emphasized this commandment, He mentioned the situation where the person might not be able to perform the prayer perfectly, during battle and combat. Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالاً أَوْ رُكْبَانًا</div><p>(And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salah on foot or riding.) meaning, pray in the appropriate manner under these circumstances, whether on foot or riding and whether facing the Qiblah or otherwise. Imam Malik reported that Nafi` related that Ibn `Umar used to describe the Fear prayer when he was asked about it and would then add, \"If there is intense fear, pray on foot, riding, facing the Qiblah and otherwise.\" Nafi` commented, \"I think that he related that to the Prophet .\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported the Hadith. </p><p>Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah has ordained the prayer by the words of your Prophet : four (Rak`ah) while residing, two Rak`ah while traveling and one Rak`ah during times of fear.\" This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, and others. </p><p>In addition, Al-Bukhari has entitled a Chapter: `Prayer while confronting the Forts and facing the Enemy'. Al-Awza`i said, \"If the victory seems near and the Muslims are unable to perform the prayer (in the normal manner), they should pray by nodding each by himself. If they are unable to nod, they should delay the prayer until fighting is finished. When they feel safe, they should pray two Rak`ah. If they are unable, they should then pray one Rak`ah that includes two prostrations. If they are unable, then Takbir alone does not suffice, so they should delay the prayer until they are safe.\" This is the same view that Makhul held. Anas bin Malik said, \"I participated in the attack on the fort of Tastar, when the light of dawn started to become clear. Suddenly, the fighting raged and the Muslims were unable to pray until the light of day spread. We then prayed (the Dawn prayer) with Abu Musa and we became victorious. I would not have been pleased if I were to gain in the life of this world and whatever is in it instead of that prayer.\" This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. </p><h2>Prayer during the Times of Peace is performed normally</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَاذْكُرُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(And when you are in safety, then remember Allah (pray)) meaning, `Perform the prayer as I have commanded you by completing its bowing, prostration, standing, sitting, and with the required attention (in the heart) and supplication.' Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).) meaning, just as He has endowed you, guided you and taught you about what benefits you in this life and the Hereafter, so thank and remember Him. Similarly, Allah said after He mentioned the prayer of Fear, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا اطْمَأْنَنتُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلَوةَ إِنَّ الصَّلَوةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَـباً مَّوْقُوتاً</div><p>(...but when you are free from danger, perform As-Salah. Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.) (4:103) </p><p>We will mention the Hadiths about the prayer of Fear and its description in Surat An-Nisa' while mentioning Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَوةَ</div><p>(When you (O Messenger Muhammad ) are among them, and lead them in As-Salah (the prayer).)

(2:234) </p><p>For instance, Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn Az-Zubayr said: I said to `Uthman bin `Affan: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them) was abrogated by the other Ayah (2:234). Therefore, why did you collect it (meaning, in the Qur'an)\" He said, \"O my nephew! I shall not change any part of the Qur'an from its place.\" </p><p>The question that Ibn Az-Zubayr asked `Uthman means: `If the ruling of the Ayah (2:240) was abrogated to four months (the `Iddah of the widow, and refer to 2:234), then what is the wisdom behind including it in the Qur'an, although its ruling has been abrogated If the Ayah (2:240) remains (in the Qur'an) after the Ayah that abrogated it (2:234), this might imply that its ruling is still valid.' `Uthman, the Leader of the faithful, answered him by stating that this is a matter of the revelation, which mentioned these Ayat in this order. `Therefore, I shall leave the Ayah where I found it in the Qur'an.' </p><p>Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said about what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا وَصِيَّةً لازْوَاجِهِم مَّتَـعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance (and residence) without turning them out, ) \"The widow used to reside, and have her provisions provided for her for a year, in her deceased husband's house. Later, the Ayah that specified the inheritance (4:12) abrogated this Ayah (2:240), and thus the widow inherits one-fourth or one-eighth of what her (deceased) husband leaves behind.\" </p><p>Ibn Abu Hatim also related that `Ali bin Abu Talhah stated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When a man died and left behind a widow, she used to remain in his house for a year for her `Iddah, all the while receiving her provisions during this time. Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.) (2:234) </p><p>So, this is the `Iddah of the widow, unless she was pregnant, for her `Iddah then ends when she gives birth. Allah also said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُنَّ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ الثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم</div><p>(In that which you leave, their (your wives') share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave.) (4:12) </p><p>So Allah specified the share of the widow in the inheritance and there was no need for the will or the Nafaqah (maintenance) which were mentioned in (2:240).\" </p><p>Ibn Abu Hatim stated that Mujahid, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that the Ayah (2:240) was abrogated by: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</div><p>(four months and ten days.) (2:234) </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Mujahid said that: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them) (2:234) used to be the `Iddah, and the widow had to remain with her (deceased) husband's family (during that period, i.e., four months and ten days). Then, Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا وَصِيَّةً لازْوَاجِهِم مَّتَـعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى مَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance (and residence) without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (e.g., lawful marriage).) </p><p>So, Allah made the rest of the year, which is seven months and twenty days, as a will and testament for her. Consequently, if she wants, she could use her right in this will and remain in the residence (for the rest of the year). Or, if she wants, she could leave the (deceased husband's) house after the four months and ten days have passed. This is the meaning of what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(...without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you.) </p><p>Therefore, the required term of `Iddah is still unchanged (refer to 2:234). </p><p>`Ata' quoted Ibn `Abbas, \"This Ayah (2:240) has abrogated (the requirement that) the widow spends the `Iddah with his (i.e., her deceased husband's) family. So, she spends her `Iddah wherever she wants. This is the meaning of what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ</div><p>(without turning them out,).\" </p><p>`Ata' also said: \"If she wants, she spends the `Iddah with his family and resides there according to the will (meaning the rest of the year). If she wants, she is allowed to leave, for Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ</div><p>(there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves,).\" </p><p>`Ata' then said: \"Then (the Ayah on) the inheritance (refer to 4:12) came and abrogated the residence. Hence, the widow spends her `Iddah wherever she wants and does not have the right to residence any more.\" </p><p>The statement of `Ata' and those who held the view that the Ayah (2:240) was abrogated by the Ayah on the inheritance (4: 12), is only valid for more than the four months and ten days (required in 2:234). However, if they mean that the four months and ten days are not required from the deceased husband's estate, then this opinion is the subject of disagreement among the scholars. As proof, they said that the widow is required to remain in her (deceased) husband's house (for four months and ten days) according to what Malik reported from Zaynab bint Ka`b bin `Ujrah. She said that Fari`ah bint Malik bin Sinan, the sister of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, told her that she came to Allah's Messenger asking him to return to her family's residence with Banu Khudrah. Her husband had pursued some of his servants who ran away, but when he reached the area of Al-Qadum, they killed him. She said, \"So I asked Allah's Messenger if I should stay with my family in Banu Khudrah, for my (deceased) husband did not leave me a residence that he owns or Nafaqah (maintenance). Allah's Messenger answered in the positive. While I was in the room, Allah's Messenger summoned me or had someone summon me and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ قُلْت»</div><p>(What did you say) I repeated the story to him about my (deceased) husband. He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«امْكُثي فِي بَيْتِكِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الكِتَابُ أَجَلَه»</div><p>(Stay at your home until the term reaches its end.) So I remained through the `Iddah term for four months and ten days in my (deceased husband's) house. Thereafter, `Uthman bin `Affan sent for me during his reign and asked me about this matter and I told him what happened. He made a judgment to the same effect.\" This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih\". </p><h2>The Necessity of the Mut`ah (Gift) at the Time of Divorce</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَـتِ مَتَـعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin (the pious).) </p><p>`Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that when Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَتَـعاً بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ</div><p>(...a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good) (2:236) was revealed, a man said, \"If I want, I will be excellent and if I do not, I will not.\" Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَـتِ مَتَـعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin (the pious).) </p><p>The scholars who ruled that the Mut`ah (reasonable gift) at the time of divorce is required for every divorced woman, whether she had a bridal-money appointed for her or not, and whether the marriage was consummated or not, relied on this Ayah (2:241) when they issued their ruling. This is the view taken on this subject by Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others among the Salaf and also Ibn Jarir. Hence, Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدْرُهُ مَتَـعاً بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ </div><p>(There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed for them their due (dowry). But bestow on them (a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.) (2:236) only mentions some specifics of this general ruling. </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُآيَـتِهِ</div><p>(Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat (Laws) to you,) meaning, what He allows, forbids, requires, His set limits, His commandments and His prohibitions are all explained and made plain and clear for you.

Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.) (2:234) </p><p>So, this is the `Iddah of the widow, unless she was pregnant, for her `Iddah then ends when she gives birth. Allah also said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُنَّ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ الثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم</div><p>(In that which you leave, their (your wives') share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave.) (4:12) </p><p>So Allah specified the share of the widow in the inheritance and there was no need for the will or the Nafaqah (maintenance) which were mentioned in (2:240).\" </p><p>Ibn Abu Hatim stated that Mujahid, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that the Ayah (2:240) was abrogated by: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</div><p>(four months and ten days.) (2:234) </p><p>Al-Bukhari reported that Mujahid said that: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them) (2:234) used to be the `Iddah, and the widow had to remain with her (deceased) husband's family (during that period, i.e., four months and ten days). Then, Allah revealed: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَجًا وَصِيَّةً لازْوَاجِهِم مَّتَـعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى مَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ</div><p>(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance (and residence) without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (e.g., lawful marriage).) </p><p>So, Allah made the rest of the year, which is seven months and twenty days, as a will and testament for her. Consequently, if she wants, she could use her right in this will and remain in the residence (for the rest of the year). Or, if she wants, she could leave the (deceased husband's) house after the four months and ten days have passed. This is the meaning of what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(...without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you.) </p><p>Therefore, the required term of `Iddah is still unchanged (refer to 2:234). </p><p>`Ata' quoted Ibn `Abbas, \"This Ayah (2:240) has abrogated (the requirement that) the widow spends the `Iddah with his (i.e., her deceased husband's) family. So, she spends her `Iddah wherever she wants. This is the meaning of what Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ</div><p>(without turning them out,).\" </p><p>`Ata' also said: \"If she wants, she spends the `Iddah with his family and resides there according to the will (meaning the rest of the year). If she wants, she is allowed to leave, for Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ</div><p>(there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves,).\" </p><p>`Ata' then said: \"Then (the Ayah on) the inheritance (refer to 4:12) came and abrogated the residence. Hence, the widow spends her `Iddah wherever she wants and does not have the right to residence any more.\" </p><p>The statement of `Ata' and those who held the view that the Ayah (2:240) was abrogated by the Ayah on the inheritance (4: 12), is only valid for more than the four months and ten days (required in 2:234). However, if they mean that the four months and ten days are not required from the deceased husband's estate, then this opinion is the subject of disagreement among the scholars. As proof, they said that the widow is required to remain in her (deceased) husband's house (for four months and ten days) according to what Malik reported from Zaynab bint Ka`b bin `Ujrah. She said that Fari`ah bint Malik bin Sinan, the sister of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, told her that she came to Allah's Messenger asking him to return to her family's residence with Banu Khudrah. Her husband had pursued some of his servants who ran away, but when he reached the area of Al-Qadum, they killed him. She said, \"So I asked Allah's Messenger if I should stay with my family in Banu Khudrah, for my (deceased) husband did not leave me a residence that he owns or Nafaqah (maintenance). Allah's Messenger answered in the positive. While I was in the room, Allah's Messenger summoned me or had someone summon me and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كَيْفَ قُلْت»</div><p>(What did you say) I repeated the story to him about my (deceased) husband. He said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«امْكُثي فِي بَيْتِكِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الكِتَابُ أَجَلَه»</div><p>(Stay at your home until the term reaches its end.) So I remained through the `Iddah term for four months and ten days in my (deceased husband's) house. Thereafter, `Uthman bin `Affan sent for me during his reign and asked me about this matter and I told him what happened. He made a judgment to the same effect.\" This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih\". </p><h2>The Necessity of the Mut`ah (Gift) at the Time of Divorce</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَـتِ مَتَـعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin (the pious).) </p><p>`Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that when Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَتَـعاً بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ</div><p>(...a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good) (2:236) was revealed, a man said, \"If I want, I will be excellent and if I do not, I will not.\" Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَـتِ مَتَـعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin (the pious).) </p><p>The scholars who ruled that the Mut`ah (reasonable gift) at the time of divorce is required for every divorced woman, whether she had a bridal-money appointed for her or not, and whether the marriage was consummated or not, relied on this Ayah (2:241) when they issued their ruling. This is the view taken on this subject by Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others among the Salaf and also Ibn Jarir. Hence, Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدْرُهُ مَتَـعاً بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ </div><p>(There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed for them their due (dowry). But bestow on them (a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.) (2:236) only mentions some specifics of this general ruling. </p><p>Allah then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُآيَـتِهِ</div><p>(Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat (Laws) to you,) meaning, what He allows, forbids, requires, His set limits, His commandments and His prohibitions are all explained and made plain and clear for you. He did not leave any matter in general terms if you needed the specifics, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may understand.) meaning, understand and comprehend. </p>"

They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was Hizqil (Ezekiel), passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, \"O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.\" The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, \"O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.\" That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, \"O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.\" They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, \"All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.\" Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago. </p><p>We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection.

These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all. </p><p>There is an authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army: Abu `Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. The Hadith then mentioned that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, \"I have knowledge regarding this matter.

Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ لإِخْوَنِهِمْ وَقَعَدُواْ لَوْ أَطَاعُونَا مَا قُتِلُوا قُلْ فَادْرَءُوا عَنْ أَنفُسِكُمُ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>((They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): \"If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth.\") (3:168) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا الْقِتَالَ لَوْلا أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَـعُ الدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَالاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ اتَّقَى وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاًأَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ</div><p>(They say: \"Our Lord!

There is not a part of my body, but suffered a shot (of an arrow), a stab (of a spear) or a strike (of a sword). Yet, here I am, I die on my bed just as the camel dies! May the eyes of the cowards never taste sleep.\" He, may Allah be pleased with him, was sorry and in pain because he did not die as martyr in battle. He was sad that he had to die on his bed! </p><h2>The Good Loan and its Reward</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</div><p>(Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times) </p><p>In this Ayah, Allah encourages His servants to spend in His cause. Allah mentioned this same Ayah in several other parts of His Glorious Qur'an. The Hadith that mentions that Allah descends (every night down on the nearest heaven to us when the last third of the night remains) states that Allah says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ يُقْرِضُ غَيْرَ عَدِيمٍ وَلَا ظَلُوم»</div><p>(Who would give a loan to He Who is neither poor nor unjust.) </p><p>Allah's statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</div><p>(He may multiply it to him many times), is similar to His statement: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنبُلَةٍ مِّاْئَةُ حَبَّةٍ وَاللَّهُ يُضَـعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains.

      "text": "<h2>The Story of the Dead People</h2><p>Ibn Abu Hatim related that Ibn `Abbas said that these people mentioned herein, were the residents of a village called Dawardan. `Ali bin `Asim said that they were from Dawardan, a village several miles away from Wasit (in Iraq). </p><p>In his Tafsir, Waki` bin Jarrah said that Ibn `Abbas commented, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ</div><p>(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death) that they were four thousand persons who escaped the plague (that broke out in their land). They said, \"We should go to a land that is free of death!\" When they reached a certain area, Allah said to them: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُوتُواْ</div><p>(\"Die.\") and they all died. Afterwards, one of the Prophets passed by them and supplicated to Allah to resurrect them and Allah brought them back to life. So, Allah stated: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ</div><p>r(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death) </p><p>Furthermore, several scholars among the Salaf said that these people were the residents of a city during the time of the Children of Israel. The weather in their land did not suit them and an epidemic broke out. They fled their land fearing death and took refuge in the wilderness. They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was Hizqil (Ezekiel), passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, \"O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.\" The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, \"O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.\" That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, \"O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.\" They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, \"All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.\" Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago. </p><p>We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection. This is why Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind,) meaning, in that He shows them His great signs, sound proofs and clear evidences. Yet, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(but most men thank not.) as they do not thank Allah for what He has given them with in their worldly life and religious affairs. </p><p>The story of the dead people (2:244 above) also indicates that no caution can ever avert destiny and that there is no refuge from Allah, but to Allah Himself. These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all. </p><p>There is an authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army: Abu `Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. The Hadith then mentioned that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, \"I have knowledge regarding this matter. I heard Allah's Messenger say: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا كَانَ بِأَرْضٍ وَأَنْتُمْ بِهَا فَلَا تَخْرُجُوا فِرَارًا مِنْه، وإِذَا سَمِعتُمْ به بأَرْضٍ فَلا تَقْدمُوا عَلَيْه»</div><p>(If it (the plague) breaks out in a land that you are in, do not leave that land to escape from it. If you hear about it in a land, do not enter it.) </p><p>`Umar then thanked Allah and went back. This Hadith is also reported in the Sahihayn. </p><h2>Abandoning Jihad does not alter Destiny</h2><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَـتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ </div><p>(And fight in the way of Allah and know that Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that just as caution does not alter destiny, abandoning Jihad will neither bring the appointed term closer nor delay it. Rather, destiny and the appointed provisions are fixed and shall never be changed or altered, neither by addition nor deletion. Similarly, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ لإِخْوَنِهِمْ وَقَعَدُواْ لَوْ أَطَاعُونَا مَا قُتِلُوا قُلْ فَادْرَءُوا عَنْ أَنفُسِكُمُ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>((They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): \"If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth.\") (3:168) </p><p>Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا الْقِتَالَ لَوْلا أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَـعُ الدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَالاٌّخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ اتَّقَى وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاًأَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ</div><p>(They say: \"Our Lord!

      "text": "<h2>The Story of the Jews Who sought a King to be appointed over Them</h2>Mujahid said that the Prophet (mentioned in the Ayah 2:246 above) is Shamwil (Samuel). Wahb bin Munabbih said: The Children of Israel remained on the straight path for a period of time after Moses. They then innovated in the religion and some of them even worshipped the idols. Yet, there were always Prophets sent among them who would command them to work righteous deeds, refrain from doing evil and who would rule them according to the commands of the Torah. When they (Israelites) committed the evil that they committed, Allah caused their enemies to overwhelm them, and many fatalities fell among them as a consequence. Their enemies also captured a great number of them, and took over large areas of their land. Earlier, anyone who would fight the Israelites would lose, because they had the Torah and the Tabut, which they inherited generation after generation ever since the time of Moses, who spoke to Allah directly. Yet, the Israelites kept indulging in misguidance until some king took the Tabut from them during a battle. That king also took possession of the Torah, and only a few of the Israelites who memorized it remained. The prophethood halted among their various tribes and only a pregnant woman remained of the offspring of Lavi (Levi), in whom the prophethood still appeared. Her husband had been killed, so the Israelites kept her in a house so that Allah may give her a boy, who would be their Prophet. The woman also kept invoking Allah to grant her a boy. Allah heard her pleas and gave her a boy whom she called `Shamwil' meaning `Allah has heard my pleas.' Some people said that the boy's name was Sham`un (Simeon), which also has a similar meaning.<p>As that boy grew, Allah raised him to be a righteous person. When he reached the age of prophethood, Allah revealed to him and commanded him to call (his people) to Him and to His Tawhid (Oneness). Shamwil called the Children of Israel (to Allah) and they asked him to appoint a king over them so that they could fight their enemies under his command. The kingship had also ended among them. Their Prophet said to them, \"What if Allah appoints a king over you, would you fulfill your vow to fight under his command\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نُقَـتِلَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِن دِيَـرِنَا وَأَبْنَآئِنَا</div><p>(They said, \"Why should we not fight in Allah's way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children\") meaning, `After our land had been confiscated and our children had been taken from us' Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْاْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِالظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers) meaning, only a few of them kept their promise, but the majority abandoned Jihad and Allah has full knowledge of them. </p>"

He then said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يُؤْتِى مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him).

For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ النَّبِيِّينَ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا</div><p>(And indeed, We have preferred some of the Prophets above others, and to Dawud We gave the Zabur (Psalms)) 17:55. </p><p>In the Ayah above, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّن كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ</div><p>(Those Messengers!

Hearing him, the Muslim man raised his hand and slapped the Jew on his face and said, `Over Muhammad too, O evil one!' The Jew went to the Prophet and complained to him and the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الْأَنْبِيَاءِ، فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ يَصْعَقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُفِيقُ، فَأَجِدُ مُوسَى بَاطِشًا بِقَائِمَةِ الْعَرْشِ، فَلَا أَدْرِي أَفَاقَ قَبْلِي أَمْ جُوزِيَ بِصَعْقَةِ الطُّورِ؟ فَلَا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الْأَنْبِيَاء»</div><p>(Don't give me superiority above the Prophets, for the people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Musa holding on to the pillar of Allah's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness Musa suffered on the Day of the Trumpet sufficed for him, or if he got up before me. So, do not give me superiority above the Prophets.) In another narration, the Prophet said, (Do not give superiority to some Prophets above others.) </p><p>The answer to this question is that this Hadith prohibits preferring some Prophets above others in cases of dispute and argument, such as the incident mentioned in the Hadith. The Hadith indicates that it is not up to creation to decide which Prophet is better, for this is Allah's decision. The creation is only required to submit to, obey and believe in Allah's decision. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَـتِ</div><p>(And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs) refers to the proofs and unequivocal evidences that testify to the truth that `Isa delivered to the Children of Israel, thus testifying that he was Allah's servant and His Messenger to them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَيَّدْنَـهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ</div><p>(And supported him with Ruh-il-Qudus) meaning Allah aided `Isa with Jibil, peace be upon him. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَـتُ وَلَـكِنِ اخْتَلَفُواْ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ ءَامَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُواْ</div><p>(If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed ـ some of them believed and others disbelieved.

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Prophet asked him about the greatest Ayah in the Book of Allah, and `Ubayy answered, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" When the Prophet repeated his question several times, `Ubayy said, \"Ayat Al-Kursi.\" The Prophet commented, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لِيَهْنِكَ الْعِلْمُ أَبَا الْمُنْذِرِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، إِنَّ لَهَا لِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ، تُقَدِّسُ الْمَلِكَ عِنْدَ سَاقِ الْعَرْش»</div><p>(Congratulations for having knowledge, O Abu Al-Mundhir!

The Prophet said to him, \"When you see her, say, `In the Name of Allah, answer to the Messenger of Allah'.\" Abu Ayyub said that when she came again, he said these words and he was able to grab her. She begged, \"I will not come again,\" so Abu Ayyub released her. Abu Ayyub went to the Prophet and the Prophet asked him, \"What did your prisoner do\" Abu Ayyub said, \"I grabbed her and she said twice, `I will not come again,' and I released her.\" The Prophet said, \"She will come back.\" Abu Ayyub said, \"So I grabbed her twice or three times, yet each time I would release her when she vowed not to come back. I would go to the Prophet who would ask me, `What is the news of your prisoner' I would say, `I grabbed her, then released her when she said that she would not return.' The Prophet would say that she would return. Once, I grabbed her and she said, `Release me and I will teach you something to recite so that no harm touches you, that is, Ayat Al-Kursi.' Abu Ayyub went to the Prophet and told him, and the Prophet said, \"She is liar, but she told the truth.\" At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith in the chapter of the virtues of the Qur'an and said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" In Arabic, `Ghoul' refers to the Jinn when they appear at night. </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded a similar story in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah, in the chapters on the virtues of the Qur'an and the description of Shaytan. In this narration, Abu Hurayrah said, </p><p>\"Allah's Messenger assigned me to keep watch over the Sadaqah (charity) of Ramadan. A person snuck in and started taking handfuls of foodstuff. I caught him and said, `By Allah, I will take you to Allah's Messenger.' He said, `Release me, for I am meek and have many dependents and am in great need.' I released him, and in the morning Allah's Messenger asked me, `What did your prisoner do yesterday, O Abu Hurayrah' I said, `O Allah's Messenger! He complained of being needy and of having many dependents, so I pitied him and let him go.' Allah's Messenger said, `Indeed, he told you a lie and will be coming again.' I believed that he would show up again, for Allah's Messenger had told me that he would return. So, I watched for him. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, `I will definitely take you to Allah's Messenger.' He said, `Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I promise I will not come back again.' I pitied him and let him go. In the morning Allah's Messenger asked me, `What did your prisoner do last night, O Abu Hurayrah!' I replied, `O Allah's Messenger! He complained of his great need and of too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free.' Allah's Messenger said, `Verily, he told you a lie; he will return.' I waited for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, `I will surely take you to Allah's Messenger as it is the third time you promised not to return, yet you returned.' He said, `Let me teach you some words which Allah will give you benefit from.' I asked, `What are they' He replied, `Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi- Allahu la ilaha illa Huwal-Hayyul-Qayyum, till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no Shaytan will come near you until morning.' So, I released him. In the morning, Allah's Messenger asked, `What did your prisoner do yesterday' I replied, `O Allah's Messenger! He claimed that he would teach me some words by which Allah will grant me some benefit, so I let him go.' Allah's Messenger asked, `What are they' I replied, `He said to me: Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi from the beginning to the end, Allahu la ilaha illa Huwal-Hayyul-Qayyum. He further said to me: (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no Shaytan will come near you until morning.' (One of the narrators) then commented that they (the Companions) were very keen to do good deeds. The Prophet said, `He spoke the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three nights, O Abu Hurayrah' Abu Hurayrah said, `No.' He said, `It was Shaytan.\"' An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith in Al-Yawm wa Al-Laylah. </p><h2>Allah's Greatest Name is in Ayat Al-Kursi</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Yazid bin As-Sakan said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say about these two Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ </div><p>(Allah!

Allah's statement,</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He) mentions that Allah is the One and Only Lord of all creation. 2. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</div><p>(Al-Hayyul-Qayyum) testifies that Allah is the Ever Living, Who never dies, Who sustains everyone and everything. All creation stands in need of Allah and totally relies on Him, while He is the Most Rich, Who stands in need of nothing created. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ أَن تَقُومَ السَّمَآءُ وَالاٌّرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ</div><p>(And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command) 30:25. 3. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ</div><p>(Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him) means, no shortcoming, unawareness or ignorance ever touches Allah. Rather, He is aware of, and controls what every soul earns, has perfect watch over everything, nothing escapes His knowledge, and no secret matter is secret to Him. Among His perfect attributes, is the fact that He is never effected by slumber or sleep. Therefore, Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ</div><p>(Neither slumber overtakes Him) indicates that no unawareness due to slumber ever overtakes Allah. Allah said afterwards, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ نَوْمٌ</div><p>(nor sleep), which is stronger than slumber. It is recorded in the Sahih that Abu Musa said, \"The Messenger of Allah delivered a speech regarding four words: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَللهَلا يَنَامُ، وَلَا يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ، يَخْفِضُ الْقِسْطَ وَيَرْفَعُهُ، يُرْفَعُ إِلَيْهِ عَمَلُ النَّهَارِ قَبْلَ عَمَلِ اللَّيْلِ، وَعَمَلُ اللَّيْلِ قَبْلَ عَمَلِ النَّهَارِ، حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ أَوِ النَّارُ لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لَأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِه»</div><p>(Allah does not sleep, and it does not befit His majesty that He sleeps. He lowers the scales and raises them. The deeds of the day are resurrected in front of Him before the deeds of the night, and the deeds of the night before the deeds of the day. His Veil is light, or fire, and if He removes it, the rays from His Face would burn whatever His sight reaches of His creation.) </p><p>4. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth) indicates that everyone is a servant for Allah, a part of His kingdom and under His power and authority. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً </div><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender)) 19:93-95. 5. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</div><p>(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) is similar to His statements, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى </div><p>(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with) 53:26, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى</div><p>(They cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased) 21:28. </p><p>These Ayat assert Allah's greatness, pride, and grace, and that no one dares to intercede with Him on behalf of anyone else, except by His permission. Indeed, the Hadith about the intercession, states that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آتِي تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ فَأَخِرُّ سَاجِدًا، فَيَدَعُنِي مَا شَاءَ اللهُ أَنْ يَدَعَنِي. ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ، وَقُلْ تُسْمَعْ، وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ قَالَ: فَيَحُدُّ لِي حَدًّا فَأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(I will stand under the Throne and fall in prostration, and Allah will allow me to remain in that position as much as He wills. I will thereafter be told, \"Raise your head, speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted\". The Prophet then said, \"He will allow me a proportion whom I will enter into Paradise.\") </p><p>6. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter) this refers to His perfect knowledge of all creation; its past, present and future. Similarly, Allah said that the angels proclaimed; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلاَّ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ لَهُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا وَمَا بَيْنَ ذلِكَ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيّاً </div><p>(And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord (O Muhammad ). To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between those two; and your Lord is never forgetful) 19:64. 7. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ</div><p>(And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills), asserts the fact that no one attains any part of Allah's knowledge except what Allah conveys and allows. This part of the Ayah indicates that no one ever acquires knowledge of Allah and in His Attributes, except what He conveys to them. For instance, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً</div><p>(But they will never compass anything of His knowledge) 20: 110. 8. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَـوَاتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ</div><p>(His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth.) </p><p>Waki` narrated in his Tafsir that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Kursi is the footstool, and no one is able to give due consideration to Allah's Throne.\" Al-Hakim recorded this Hadith in his Mustadrak from Ibn `Abbas, who did not relate it to the Prophet . Al-Hakim said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Sahihs, and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\" In addition, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If the seven heavens and the seven earths were flattened and laid side by side, they would add up to the size of a ring in a desert, compared to the Kursi.\" 9. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَؤُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</div><p>(And He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them) meaning, it does not burden or cause Him fatigue to protect the heavens and earth and all that is in between them. Rather, this is an easy matter for Him. Further, Allah sustains everything, has perfect watch over everything, nothing ever escapes His knowledge and no matter is ever a secret to Him. All matters are insignificant, modest and humble before Him. He is the Most Rich, worthy of all praise. He does what He wills, and no one can ask Him about what He does, while they will be asked. He has supreme power over all things and perfect alertness concerning everything. He is the Most High, the Greatest, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, and no Lord other than Him. </p><p>10. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْعَظِيمُ</div><p>(And He is the Most High, the Most Great) is similar to His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ</div><p>(the Most Great, the Most High) 13:9. </p><p>These and similar Ayat and authentic Hadiths about Allah's Attributes must be treated the way the Salaf (righteous ancestors) treated them by accepting their apparent meanings without equating them with the attributes of the creation or altering their apparent meanings. </p>"

Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.\" </p><p>It was reported that the Ansar were the reason behind revealing this Ayah, although its indication is general in meaning. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that before Islam, \"When (an Ansar) woman would not bear children who would live, she would vow that if she gives birth to a child who remains alive, she would raise him as a Jew. When Banu An-Nadir (the Jewish tribe) were evacuated from Al-Madinah, some of the children of the Ansar were being raised among them, and the Ansar said, `We will not abandon our children.' Allah revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ</div><p>(There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path.)\" </p><p>Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. As for the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said to a man, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَسْلِم»</div><p>قَالَ: إِنِّي أَجِدُنِي كَارِهًا قَالَ: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنْ كُنْتَ كَارِهًا»</div><p>(\"Embrace Islam.\" The man said, \"I dislike it.\" The Prophet said, \"Even if you dislike it.\") </p><p>First, this is an authentic Hadith, with only three narrators between Imam Ahmad and the Prophet . However, it is not relevant to the subject under discussion, for the Prophet did not force that man to become Muslim. The Prophet merely invited this man to become Muslim, and he replied that he does not find himself eager to become Muslim. The Prophet said to the man that even though he dislikes embracing Islam, he should still embrace it, `for Allah will grant you sincerity and true intent.' </p><h2>Tawhid is the Most Trustworthy Handhold</h2><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّـغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower) is in reference to, \"Whoever shuns the rivals of Allah, the idols, and those that Shaytan calls to be worshipped besides Allah, whoever believes in Allah's Oneness, worships Him alone and testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, then </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى</div><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold.) </p><p>Therefore, this person will have acquired firmness in the religion and proceeded on the correct way and the straight path. Abu Al-Qasim Al-Baghawi recorded that `Umar said, \"Jibt means magic, and Taghut means Shaytan. Verily, courage and cowardice are two instincts that appear in men, the courageous fights for those whom he does not know and the coward runs away from defending his own mother. Man's honor resides with his religion and his status is based upon his character, even if he was Persian or Nabatian.\" `Umar's statement that Taghut is Shaytan is very sound, for this meaning includes every type of evil that the ignorant people of Jahiliyyah (pre Islamic era of ignorace) fell into, such as worshipping idols, referring to them for judgement, and invoking them for victory. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا</div><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break) means, \"He will have hold of the true religion with the strongest grasp.\" Allah equated this adherence to the firm handhold that never breaks because it is built solid and because its handle is firmly connected. This is why Allah said here, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا</div><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.) </p><p>Mujahid said, \"The most trustworthy handhold is Iman (faith).\" As-Suddi said that it refers to Islam. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qays bin `Abbad said, \"I was in the Masjid when a man whose face showed signs of humbleness came and prayed two Rak`ahs that were modest in length. The people said, `This is a man from among the people of Paradise.' When he left, I followed him until he entered his house, and I entered it after him and spoke with him. When he felt at ease, I said to him, `When you entered the Masjid, the people said such and such things.' He said, `All praise is due to Allah! No one should say what he has no knowledge of. I will tell you why they said that. I saw a vision during the time of the Messenger of Allah, and I narrated it to him. I saw that I was in a green garden, ' and he described the garden's plants and spaciousness, `and there was an iron pole in the middle of the garden affixed in the earth and its tip reached the sky. On its tip, there was a handle, and I was told to ascend the pole. I said, `I cannot.' Then a helper came and raised my robe from behind and said to me, `Ascend.' I ascended until I grasped the handle and he said to me, `Hold on to the handle.' I awoke from that dream with the handle in my hand. I went to the Messenger of Allah and told him about the vision and he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَمَّا الرَّوْضَةُ فَرَوْضَةُ الْإِسْلَامِ، وَأَمَّا الْعَمُودُ فَعَمُودُ الْإِسْلَامِ، وَأَمَّا الْعُرْوَةُ فَهِيَ الْعُرْوَةُ الْوُثْقَى، أَنْتَ عَلَى الْإِسْلَامِ حَتَّى تَمُوت»</div><p>(As for the garden, it represents Islam; as for the pole, it represents the pillar of Islam; and the handle represents the most trustworthy handhold. You shall remain Muslim until you die.) </p><p>This Companion was `Abdullah bin Salam.\" </p><p>This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs; and Al-Bukhari also recorded it with another chain of narration. </p>"

Mujahid said, \"The kings who ruled the eastern and western parts of the world are four, two believers and two disbelievers. As for the two believing kings, they were Sulayman bin Dawud and Dhul-Qarnayn. As for the two disbelieving kings, they were Nimrod and Nebuchadnezzar.\" Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ</div><p>(Have you not looked) meaning, \"With your heart, O Muhammad!\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى الَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ</div><p>(at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord) meaning, about the existence of Allah.

This is why the Ayah continued, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ</div><p>(Because Allah had given him the kingdom. ) </p><p>It appears that Nimrod asked Ibrahim to produce proof that Allah exists. Ibrahim replied, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ</div><p>(My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death) meaning, \"The proof of Allah's existence is the creations that exist after they were nothing and perish after they had existed. This only proves the existence of the Creator, Who does what He wills, for these things could not have occurred on their own without a Creator who created them, and He is the Lord that I call to for worship, Alone without a partner.\" </p><p>This is when Nimrod said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ</div><p>(I give life and cause death.) </p><p>Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ishaq and As-Suddi said that he meant, \"Two men who deserved execution were to be brought before me, and I would command that one of them be killed, and he would be killed. I would command that the second man be pardoned, and he would be pardoned. This is how I bring life and death.\" However, it appears that since Nimrod did not deny the existence of a Creator, his statement did not mean what Qatadah said it meant. This explanation does not provide an answer to what Ibrahim said. Nimrod arrogantly and defiantly claimed that he was the creator and pretended that it was he who brings life and death. Later on, Fir`awn imitated him and announced, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى</div><p>(I know not that you have a god other than me) 28: 38. </p><p>This is why Ibrahim said to Nimrod, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west.) </p><p>This Ayah means, \"You claim that it is you who brings life and death. He who brings life and death controls the existence and creates whatever is in it, including controlling its planets and their movements. For instance, the sun rises everyday from the east. Therefore, if you were god, as you claimed, bringing life and death, then bring the sun from the west.\" Since the king was aware of his weakness, inadequacy and that he was not able to reply to Ibrahim's request, he was idle, silent and unable to comment. Therefore, the proof was established against him. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(And Allah guides not the people, who are wrongdoers) meaning, Allah deprives the unjust people of any valid proof or argument. Furthermore, their false proof and arguments are annulled by their Lord, and they have earned His anger and will suffer severe torment. </p><p>The meaning that we provided is better than the meaning that some philosophers offered, claiming that Ibrahim used the second argument because it was clearer than the first one.

      "text": "<h2>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</h2><p>The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ</div><p>e(My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</div><p>(\"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe\" He (Ibrahim) said: \"Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.\") </p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالشَّكِّ مِنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِذْ قَالَ</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</div><p>(We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, \"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" Allah said, \"Don't you believe\" Ibrahim said, \"Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.\") </p><p>The Prophet's statement in the Hadith means, \"We are more liable to seek certainty.\" </p><h2>The Answer to Al-Khalil's Request</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ الطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ</div><p>(He said: \"Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.\") </p><p>Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur'an did not mention it. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ</div><p>(cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim's hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah's leave and power. \" This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees. </p><p>`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</div><p>(but to be stronger in Faith), \"To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur'an that brings more hope than this Ayah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, \"Which Ayah in the Qur'an carries more hope for you\" Ibn `Amr said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لاَ تَقْنَطُواْ</div><p>(Say: \"O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.) 39:53. </p><p>Ibn `Abbas said, \"But I say that it is Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى</div><p>(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, \"My Lord!

      "text": "<h2>Rewards of Spending in Allah's Cause</h2><p>This is a parable that Allah made of the multiplication of rewards for those who spend in His cause, seeking His pleasure. Allah multiplies the good deed ten to seven hundred times. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah...) </p><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr commented, \"Meaning spending in Allah's obedience.\" Makhul said that the Ayah means, \"Spending on Jihad, on horse stalls, weapons and so forth.\" The parable in the Ayah is more impressive on the heart than merely mentioning the number seven hundred. This Ayah indicates that Allah `grows' the good deeds for its doers, just as He grows the plant for whoever sows it in fertile land. The Sunnah also mentions that the deeds are multiplied up to seven hundred folds. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that a man once gave away a camel, with its bridle on, in the cause of Allah and the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَتَأْتِيَنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِسَبْعِمِائَةِ نَاقَةٍ مَخْطُومَة»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, you will have seven hundred camels with their bridles.) </p><p>Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, and Muslim's narration reads, \"A man brought a camel with its bridle on and said, `O Messenger of Allah! This is in the sake of Allah.' The Messenger said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَكَ بِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ سَبْعُمِائَةِ نَاقَة»</div><p>(You will earn seven hundred camels as reward for it on the Day of Resurrection. ) </p><p>Another Hadith: Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«كُلُّ عَمَلِ ابْنِ آدَمَ يُضَاعَفُ، الْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشَرِ أَمْثَالِهَا، إِلَى سَبْعِمِائَةِ ضِعْفٍ، إِلى مَا شَاءَ اللهُ، يَقُولُ اللهُ: إِلَّا الصَّوْمَ فَإِنَّهُ لِي، وَأَنَا أَجْزِي بِهِ، يَدَعُ طَعَامَهُ وَشَهْوَتَهُ مِنْ أَجْلِي، وَلِلصَّائِمِ فَرْحَتَانِ: فَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ فِطْرِهِ وَفَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ لِقَاءِ رَبِّهِ، وَلَخَلُوفُ فَمِ الصَّائِمِ أَطْيَبُ عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنْ رِيحِ الْمِسْكِ، الصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، الصَّومُ جُنَّة»</div><p>(Every good deed that the son of Adam performs will be multiplied ten folds, to seven hundred folds, to many other folds, to as much as Allah wills. Allah said, \"Except the fast, for it is for Me and I will reward for it. One abandons his food and desire in My sake.\" The fasting person has two times of happiness: when he breaks his fast and when he meets his Lord. Verily, the odor that comes from the mouth of whoever fasts is more pure to Allah than the scent of musk. Fasting is a shield (against sinning), fasting is a shield.) Muslim recorded this Hadith. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يُضَـعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills) is according to the person's sincerity in his deeds. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower) meaning, His Favor is so wide that it encompasses much more than His creation, and He has full knowledge in whoever deserves it, or does not deserve it. All the praise and thanks are due to Allah. </p>"

In this case, the reward of giving away charity is not sufficient enough to nullify the harm and reminders. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَالَّذِى يُنفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men) meaning, \"Do not nullify your acts of charity by following them with reminders and harm, just like the charity of those who give it to show off to people.\" The boasting person pretends to give away charity for Allah's sake, but in reality seeks to gain people's praise and the reputation of being kind or generous, or other material gains of this life. All the while, he does not think about Allah or gaining His pleasure and generous rewards, and this is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day.) </p><p>Allah next set the example of whoever gives charity to show off. Ad-Dahhak commented that the example fits one who follows his acts of charity with reminders or harm. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ</div><p>(His likeness is the likeness of Safwan) where Safwan, from is Safwanah, meaning `the smooth rocks,' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ</div><p>(on which is little dust; on it falls a Wabil) meaning, heavy rain, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْدًا</div><p>(which leaves it bare.) This Ayah means that heavy rain left the Safwan completely barren of dust. Such is the case with Allah's action regarding the work of those who show off, as their deeds are bound to vanish and disappear, even though people think that these deeds are as plentiful as specks of dust. So Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.) </p>"

The Ayah indicates that the garden on the Rabwah is always fertile, for if heavy rain does not fall on it, light rain will suffice for it. Such is the case regarding the believer's good deeds, for they never become barren. Rather, Allah accepts the believer's righteous deeds and increases them, each according to his deeds. This is why Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</div><p>(And Allah is All-Seer of what you do) meaning, none of His servants' deeds ever escapes His perfect watch. </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Example of Evil Deeds Nullifying Good Deeds</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas and `Ubayd bin `Umayr said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, \"According to your opinion, about whom was this Ayah revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ</div><p>(Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines...).\" </p><p>They said, \"Allah knows best.\" `Umar became angry and said, \"Say we know or we do not know.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"O Leader of the Faithful! I have an opinion about it.\" `Umar said, \"O my nephew! Say your opinion and do not belittle yourself.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is an example set for a deed.\" `Umar said, \"What type of deed\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"For a wealthy man who works in Allah's pleasure and then Allah sends Shaytan to him, and he works in disobedience, until he annuls his good works.\" </p><p>This Hadith suffices as an explanation for the Ayah, for it explains the example it sets by a person who does good first and then follows it with evil, may Allah save us from this end. So, this man annulled his previous good works with his latter evil works. When he desperately needed the deeds of the former type, there were none. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ</div><p>(while he is striken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a whirlwind) with heavy wind, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِيهِ نَارٌ فَاحْتَرَقَتْ</div><p>(that is fiery, so that it is burnt) meaning, its fruits were burnt and its trees were destroyed. Therefore, what will his condition be like </p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah has set a good parable, and all His parables are good. He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ</div><p>(Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein.) </p><p>But he lost all this in his old age, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ</div><p>(while he is striken with old age) while his offspring and children are weak just before the end of his life. Then a lightning storm came and destroyed his garden. Then he did not have the strength to grow another garden, nor did his offspring offer enough help. This is the condition of the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection when he returns to Allah, for he will not have any good deeds to provide an excuse - or refuge - for him, just as the man in the parable had no strength to replant the garden. The disbeliever will not find anything to resort to for help, just as the offspring of the man in the parable did not provide him with help. So he will be deprived of his reward when he most needs it, just as the man in the parable was deprived of Allah's garden when he most needed it, when he became old and his offspring weak.\" </p><p>In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that the Messenger of Allah used to say in his supplication, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْ أَوْسَعَ رِزْقِكَ عَلَيَ عِنْدَ كِبَرِ سِنِّي وَانْقِضَاءِ عُمُرِي»</div><p>(O Allah! Make Your biggest provision for me when I am old in age and at the time my life ends.) </p><p>This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذلِكَ يُبيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(Thus Allah makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought) meaning, comprehend and understand the parables and their intended implications. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ </div><p>(And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allah and His signs)) 29:43. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ أَنفِقُواْ مِن طَيّبَـتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مّنَ الاْرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُم بِأَخِذِيهِ إِلا أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ الشَّيْطَـنُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَآء وَاللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَاللَّهُ وسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ</div>"

Therefore, you will not be asked about the deeds or wickedness of those who receive it.\" This is a sound meaning indicating that when one spends in charity for Allah's sake, then his reward will be with Allah. He will not be asked if the charity unintentionally reached righteous, evil, deserving or undeserving persons, for he will be rewarded for his good intention. The proof to this statement is the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</div><p>(And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.) </p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ رَجُلٌ: لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ زَانِيَةٍ، فَأَصْبَحَ النَّاسُ يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ غَنِيَ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى غَنِيَ، قَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى غَنِيَ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ سَارِقٍ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى سَارِقٍ، فَقَالَ:اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، وَعَلَى غَنِيَ، وَعَلَى سَارِقٍ. فَأُتِيَ فَقِيلَ لَهُ: أَمَّا صَدَقَتُكَ فَقَدْ قُبِلَتْ، وَأَمَّا الزَّانِيَةُ فَلَعَلَّهَا أَنْ تَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ زِنَاهَا، وَلَعَلَّ الْغَنِيَّ يَعْتَبِرُ فَيُنْفِقُ مِمَّا أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ، وَلَعَلَّ السَّارِقَ أَنْ يَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ سَرِقَتِه»</div><p>(A man said, \"Tonight, I shall give charity.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress.

Tonight, I shall give alms again.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a wealthy person was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I gave alms) to a wealthy man. Tonight, I shall again give charity.\" So he went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a thief. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a thief was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I have given alms) to an adulteress, a wealthy man and a thief.\" Then, someone came to him and said, \"The alms that you gave away were accepted. As for the adulteress, the alms might make her abstain from adultery. As for the wealthy man, it might make him take a lesson and spend his wealth that Allah has given him. As for the thief, it might make him abstain from stealing.\") </p><h2>Who Deserves Charity</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِلْفُقَرَآءِ الَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</div><p>((Charity is) for the poor, who in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel)) meaning, the migrants who migrated to Allah and His Messenger, resided in Al-Madinah and did not have resources that sufficiently provided them with their needs, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And cannot Darban (move about) in the land) meaning, \"They cannot travel in the land to seek means of livelihood.\" Allah said in other instances using a variation of the word Darban </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُواْ مِنَ الصَّلوةِ</div><p>(And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the Salah (the prayer)) 4:101, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُمْ مَّرْضَى وَءَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَءَاخَرُونَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَاقْرَءُواْ</div><p>(He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause) 73:20. </p><p>Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ</div><p>(The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty) meaning, those who do not know their situation think that they are well-off, because they are modest in their clothes and speech. There is a Hadith with this meaning that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّهُ التَّمْرَةُ وَالتَّمْرَتَانِ، وَاللُّقْمَةُ وَاللُّقْمَتَانِ، وَالْأُكْلَةُ وَالْأُكْلَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيهِ، وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِ، وَلَا يَسْأَلُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا»</div><p>(The Miskin (needy) is not he who wanders about and whose need is sufficed by a date or two, a bite or two or a meal or two. Rather, the Miskin is he who neither has enough resources to sustain him, all the while people are unaware of his need so they do not give to him, nor does he ask people for anything.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ</div><p>(You may know them by their mark) means, \"Those who have good minds discover their situation,\" just as Allah said in other instances, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سِيمَـهُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ</div><p>(The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces) 48:29, and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</div><p>(But surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) 47:30. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْـَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا</div><p>(they do not beg of people at all) means, they do not beg and, thus, do not require people to provide them with more than what they actually need. Indeed, those who ask people for help, while having what suffices for their needs, have begged. </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"My mother sent me to the Messenger of Allah to ask him for help, but when I came by him I sat down. The Prophet faced me and said to me, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى أَغْنَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَعَفَّ أَعَفَّهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَكَفَّ كَفَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنْ سَأَلَ وَلَهُ قِيمَةُ أُوقِيَّةٍ فَقَدْ أَلْحَف»</div><p>(Whoever felt satisfied, then Allah will enrich him. Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.) </p><p>Abu Sa`id said, \"I said to myself, `I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet for anything.\" This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well) indicates that no charity escapes Him, and He will reward it fully and perfectly on the Day of Resurrection, when it is most desperately needed. </p><h2>Praise for those who Spend in Charity</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ بِالَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُم عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(Those who spend their wealth (in Allah's cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.) </p><p>This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَإِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللهِ إِلَّا ازْدَدْتَ بِهَا دَرَجَةً وَرِفْعَةً، حَتَّى مَا تَجْعَلُ فِي فِي امْرَأَتِك»</div><p>(You will not spend charity with which you seek Allah's Face, but you will ascend a higher degree and status because of it, including what you put in your wife's mouth.) </p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمَ إِذَا أَنْفَقَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ نَفَقَةً يَحْتَسِبُهَا، كَانَتْ لَهُ صَدَقَة»</div><p>(When the Muslim spends on his family while awaiting the reward for it from Allah, it will be written as charity for him.) </p><p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this Hadith. </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</div><p>(shall have their reward with their Lord), on the Day of Resurrection, as reward for what they spent in acts of obedience. We previously explained the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.) </p>"

      "text": "<h2>The Punishment for Dealing with Riba (Interest and Usury)</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the righteous believers who give charity, pay Zakah and spend on their relatives and families at various times and conditions, He then mentioned those who deal in usury and illegally acquire people's money, using various evil methods and wicked ways. Allah describes the condition of these people when they are resurrected from their graves and brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ</div><p>(Those who eat Riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity.) </p><p>This Ayah means, on the Day of Resurrection, these people will get up from their graves just as the person afflicted by insanity or possesed by a demon would. Ibn `Abbas said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, those who consume Riba will be resurrected while insane and suffering from seizures.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded this and then commented, \"This Tafsir was reported from `Awf bin Malik, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Samurah bin Jundub said in the long Hadith about the dream that the Prophet had, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَأَتْينَا عَلَى نَهْرٍ حَسِبْتُ أَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ: أَحْمَرَ مِثْلَ الدَّمِ، وَإِذَا فِي النَّهْرِ رَجُلٌ سَابِحٌ يَسْبَحُ، وَإِذَا عَلَى شَطِّ النَّهْرِ رَجُلٌ قَدْ جَمَعَ عِنْدَهُ حِجَارَةً كَثِيرَةً،وَإِذَا ذَلِكَ السَّابِحُ يَسْبَحُ مَا يَسْبَحُ، ثُمَّ يَأْتِي ذَلِكَ الَّذِي قَدْ جَمَعَ الْحِجَارَةَ عِنْدَهُ، فَيَفْغَرُ لَهُ فَاهُ فَيُلْقِمُهُ حَجَرًا»</div><p>(We reached a river -the narrator said, \"I thought he said that the river was as red as blood\"- and found that a man was swimming in the river, and on its bank there was another man standing with a large collection of stones next to him. The man in the river would swim, then come to the man who had collected the stones and open his mouth, and the other man would throw a stone in his mouth.) </p><p>The explanation of this dream was that the person in the river was one who consumed Riba. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَواْ وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَواْ</div><p>(That is because they say: \"Trading is only like Riba,\" whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba) indicates that the disbelievers claimed that Riba was allowed due to the fact that they rejected Allah's commandments, not that they equated Riba with regular trade. The disbelievers did not recognize that Allah allowed trade in the Qur'an, for if they did, they would have said, \"Riba is trade.\" Rather, they said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَواْ</div><p>(Trading is only like Riba) meaning, they are similar, so why did Allah allow this, but did not allow that, they asked in defiance of Allah's commandments. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَواْ</div><p>(Whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba) might be a continuation of the answer to the disbelievers' claim, who uttered it, although they knew that Allah decided that ruling on trade is different from that of Riba. Indeed, Allah is the Most Knowledgeable, Most Wise, Whose decision is never resisted. Allah is never asked about what He does, while they will be asked. He is knowledgeable of the true reality of all things and the benefits they carry. He knows what benefits His servants, so He allows it for them, and what harms them, so He forbids them from it. He is more merciful with them than the mother with her own infant. </p><p>Thereafter, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَن جَآءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّنْ رَّبِّهِ فَانتَهَى فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge),) meaning, those who have knowledge that Allah made usury unlawful, and refrain from indulging in it as soon as they acquire this knowledge, then Allah will forgive their previous dealings in Riba, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَف</div><p>(Allah has forgiven what is past.) </p><p>On the day Makkah was conquered the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«وَكُلُّ رِبًا فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ مَوْضُوعٌ تَحْتَ قَدَمَيَ هَاتَيْنِ، وَأَوَّلُ رِبًا أَضَعُ، رِبَا الْعَبَّاس»</div><p>(All cases of Riba during the time of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period of ignorance) is annulled and under my feet, and the first Riba I annul is the Riba of Al-'Abbas (the Prophet's uncle).) </p><p>We should mention that the Prophet did not require the return of the interest that they gained on their Riba during the time of Jahiliyyah. Rather, he pardoned the cases of Riba that occured in the past, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge).) </p><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ</div><p>(shall not be punished for the past) refers to the Riba one consumed before it was prohibited. Allah then said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ عَادَ</div><p>(But whoever returns) meaning, deals in Riba after gaining knowledge that Allah prohibited it, then that warrants punishment, and in this case, the proof will have been established against such person. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(such are the dwellers of the Fire ـ they will abide therein forever.) </p><p>Abu Dawud recorded that Jabir said, \"When </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ</div><p>(Those who eat Riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ لَمْ يَذَرِ الْمُخَابَرَةَ فَلْيُؤْذِنْ بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللهِ وَرَسُولِه»</div><p>(Whoever does not refrain from Mukhabarah, then let him receive a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)\" </p><p>Al-Hakim also recorded this in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of Muslim, and he did not record it.\" Mukhabarah (sharecropping), farming land in return for some of its produce, was prohibited. Muzabanah, trading fresh dates still on trees with dried dates already on the ground, was prohibited. Muhaqalah, which refers to trading produce not yet harvested, with crops already harvested, was also prohibited. These were prohibited to eradicate the possibility that Riba might be involved, for the quality and equity of such items are only known after they become dry. </p><p>The subject of Riba is a difficult subject for many scholars. We should mention that the Leader of the Faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, said, \"I wished that the Messenger of Allah had made three matters clearer for us, so that we could refer to his decision: the grandfather (regarding inheriting from his grandchildren), the Kalalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs) and some types of Riba.\" `Umar was refering to the types of transactions where it is not clear whether they involve Riba or not. The Shari`ah supports the rule that for any matter that is unlawful, then the means to it are also unlafwful, because whatever results in the unlawful is unlawful, in the same way that whenever an obligation will not be complete except with something, then that something is itself an obligation. </p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْحَلَالَ بَيِّنٌ وَإِنَّ الْحَرَامَ بَيِّنٌ، وَبَيْنَ ذَلِكَ أُمُورٌ مُشْتَبِهَاتٌ، فَمَنِ اتَّقَى الشُّبُهَاتِ اسْتَبْرَأَ لِدِينِهِ وَعِرْضِهِ، وَمَنْ وَقَعَ فِي الشُّبُهَاتِ وَقَعَ فِي الْحَرَامِ، كَالرَّاعِي يَرْعَى حَولَ الْحِمَى يُوشِكُ أَنْ يَرْتَعَ فِيه»</div><p>(Both lawful and unlawful things are evident, but in between them there are matters that are not clear. So whoever saves himself from these unclear matters, he saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these unclear matters, he will have fallen into the prohibitions, just like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near a private pasture, at any moment he is liable to enter it.) </p><p>The Sunan records that Al-Hasan bin `Ali said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«دَعْ مَا يَرِيبُكَ إِلَى مَا لَا يَرِيبُك»</div><p>(Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.) </p><p>Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that `Umar said, \"The Ayah about Riba was one of the last Ayat to be revealed, and the Messenger of Allah died before he explained it to us. So leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.\" </p><p>Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الرِّبَا سَبْعُونَ حُوبًا، أَيْسَرُهَا أَنْ يَنْكِحَ الرَّجُلُ أُمَّه»</div><p>(Riba is seventy types, the least of which is equal to one having sexual intercourse with his mother.) </p><p>Continuing on the subject of prohibiting the means that lead to the unlawful, there is a Hadith that Ahmad recorded in which `A'ishah said, \"When the Ayat in Surat Al-Baqarah about Riba were revealed, the Messenger of Allah went out to the Masjid and recited them and also prohibited trading in alcohol.\" The Six collections recorded this Hadith, with the exception of At-Tirmidhi. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ، حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّحُومُ فَجَمَلُوهَا فَبَاعُوهَا، وَأَكَلُوا أَثْمَانَهَا»</div><p>(May Allah curse the Jews! Allah forbade them to eat animal fat, but they melted it and sold it, eating its price.) </p><p>`Ali and Ibn Mas`ud narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَعَنَ اللهُ آكِلَ الرِّبَا وَمُوكِلَهُ وَشَاهِدَيْهِ وَكَاتِبَه»</div><p>(May Allah curse whoever consumes Riba, whoever pays Riba, the two who are witnesses to it, and the scribe who records it.) </p><p>They say they only have witnesses and a scribe to write the Riba contract when they want it to appear to be a legitimate agreement, but it is still invalid because the ruling is applied to the agreement itself, not the form that it appears in. Verily, deeds are judged by their intentions. d </p>"

One day, Abu Qatadah came looking for the debtor and a young boy came out, and he asked him about the debtor and found out that he was in the house eating. Abu Qatadah said in a loud voice, \"O Fellow! Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.\" The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, \"Why are you hiding from me\" The man said, \"I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.\" Abu Qatadah said, \"By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time\" He said, \"Yes.\" Abu Qatadah cried and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ،كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.)\" </p><p>Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih. </p><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ: مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا؟ فَقَالَ: مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ آخِرِهَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ، وَكُنْتُ رَجُلًا أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ، وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ، فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ، قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ: أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ، ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, \"What deeds did you perform for Me in your life\" He will say, \"O Lord!

He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. Allah also warned them against His torment, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.

One day, Abu Qatadah came looking for the debtor and a young boy came out, and he asked him about the debtor and found out that he was in the house eating. Abu Qatadah said in a loud voice, \"O Fellow! Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.\" The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, \"Why are you hiding from me\" The man said, \"I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.\" Abu Qatadah said, \"By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time\" He said, \"Yes.\" Abu Qatadah cried and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ،كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.)\" </p><p>Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih. </p><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ: مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا؟ فَقَالَ: مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ آخِرِهَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ، وَكُنْتُ رَجُلًا أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ، وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ، فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ، قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ: أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ، ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, \"What deeds did you perform for Me in your life\" He will say, \"O Lord!

Allah further advised His servants, by reminding them that this life will soon end and all the wealth in it will vanish. He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. Allah also warned them against His torment, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.

Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ</div><p>(Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write.) </p><p>Some say that this Ayah indicates that agreeing to become a witness is Fard Kifayah (required on at least a part of the Muslim Ummah). However, the majority of the scholars say that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ</div><p>(And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called) is referring to testifying to what the witnesses actually witnessed, thus befitting their description of being `witnesses'. Therefore, when the witness is called to testify to what he witnessed, he is required to give testimony, unless this obligation was already fulfilled, in which case such testimony becomes Fard Kifayah. Mujahid and Abu Mijlaz said, \"If you are called to be a witness, then you have the choice to agree. If you witnessed and were called to testify, then come forward.\" It was reported that Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the obligation includes both cases, agreeing to be a witness and testifying to what one witnessed. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَسْـَمُواْ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَى أَجَلِهِ</div><p>(You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or large, for its fixed term) perfects this direction from Allah by commanding that the debt be written, whether the amount is large or small. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَسْـَمُواْ</div><p>(You should not become weary) meaning, do not be discouraged against writing transactions and their terms, whether the amount involved is large or small. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَـدَةِ وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ</div><p>(that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) means, writing transactions that will be fulfillled at a later date is more just with Allah meaning better and more convenient in order to preserve the terms of the contract. Therefore, recording such agreements helps the witnesses, when they see their handwriting - or signatures - later on and thus remember what they witnessed, for it is possible that the witnesses might forget what they witnessed. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ</div><p>(And more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) meaning, this helps repel any doubt. Since if you need to refer to the contract that you wrote and the doubt will end. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَـرَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلاَّ تَكْتُبُوهَا</div><p>(save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down) indicates that if the transaction will be fulfilled immediately, then there is no harm if it is not recorded. </p><p>As for requiring witnesses to be present in trading transactions, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَشْهِدُواْ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ</div><p>(But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. ) </p><p>However, this command was abrogated by, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِى اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَـنَتَهُ</div><p>(Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).) </p><p>Or, it could be that having witnesses in such cases is only recommended and not obligatory, as evident from the Hadith that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari narrated which Imam Ahmad collected. `Umarah bin Khuzaymah Al-Ansari said that his uncle, who was among the Prophet's Companions, told him that the Prophet was making a deal for a horse with a bedouin man. The Prophet asked the bedouin to follow him so that he could pay him the price of the horse. The Prophet went ahead of the bedouin. The bedouin met several men who tried to buy his horse, not knowing if the Prophet was actually determined to buy it. Some people offered more money for the horse than the Prophet had. The bedouin man said to the Prophet , \"If you want to buy this horse, then buy it or I will sell it to someone else.\" When he heard the bedouin man's words, the Prophet stood up and said, \"Have I not bought that horse from you\" The bedouin said, \"By Allah! I have not sold it to you.\" The Prophet said, \"Rather, I did buy it from you.\" The people gathered around the Prophet and the Bedouin while they were disputing, and the bedouin said, \"Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse.\" Meanwhile, the Muslims who came said to the bedouin, \"Woe to you! The Prophet only says the truth.\" When Khuzaymah bin Thabit came and heard the dispute between the Prophet and the bedouin who was saying, \"Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse, \" Khuzaymah said, \"I bear witness that you sold him the horse.\" The Prophet said to Khuzaymah, \"What is the basis of your testimony\" Khuzaymah said, \"That I entrusted you, O Messenger of Allah!\" Therefore, the Messenger made Khuzaymah's testimony equal to the testimony of two men. This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa ®299؛. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلاَ شَهِيدٌ</div><p>(Let neither scribe nor witness suffer (or cause) any harm) also indicates that the scribe and the witness must not cause any harm, such as, when the scribe writes other than what he is being dictated, or the witness testifies to other than what he heard or conceals his testimony. This is the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah.\" </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَفْعَلُواْ فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ</div><p>(But if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you) means, \"If you defy what you were commanded and commit what you were prohibited, then it is because of the sin that resides and remains with you; sin that you never release or rid yourselves from.\" </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</div><p>(So have Taqwa of Allah) means, fear Him, remember His watch over you, implement His command and avoid what He prohibited, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And Allah teaches you. ) Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يِـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إَن تَتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا</div><p>(O you who believe!

Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah's Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah's leave.

This only demonstrates Allah's kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُم بِهِ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.) </p><p>This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself - or passing thoughts - they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one's mind is a part of faith.

Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</div><p>(And they say, \"We hear, and we obey\") means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا</div><p>((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah's forgiveness, mercy and kindness. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا</div><p>(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah's kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُم بِهِ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.) </p><p>This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself - or passing thoughts - they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one's mind is a part of faith. Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ</div><p>(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ</div><p>(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for. </p><p>Allah then said, mentioning what the believers said while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا</div><p>(\"Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,\") meaning, \"If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.\" We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, \"I shall (accept your supplication).\" There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, \"I did (accept your supplication).\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا</div><p>(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, \"Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.\" Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, \"I shall (accept your supplication).\" Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, \"I did (accept your supplication).\" There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»</div><p>(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ</div><p>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ</div><p>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.) </p><p>We mentioned that Allah said, \"I shall (accept your supplication)\" in one narration, and, \"I did (accept your supplication),\" in another narration. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْفُ عَنَّا</div><p>(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاغْفِرْ لَنَآ</div><p>(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَارْحَمْنَآ</div><p>(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah's forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.\" We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, \"I shall,\" in one narration and, \"I did,\" in another narration. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتَ مَوْلَـنَا</div><p>(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, \"I shall,\" in one narration, and, \"I did,\" in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas. </p><p>Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانْصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say \"Amin.\"</p>"
